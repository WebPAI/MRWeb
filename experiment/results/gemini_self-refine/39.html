        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">IBM on Tuesday announced a prepackaged and pretested cluster that is powered by Advanced Micro Devices Inc.’s 64-bit Opteron processor.</p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">IBM, of Armonk, N.Y., is combining its Opteron-based eServer 325 server—which targets scientific and technical computing users—with systems management software and storage devices to offer a bundled package that can run Linux and Windows operating systems.</p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">The new offering, which will be available later this month or in early December, is part of IBM’s eServer Cluster 1350, which also includes bundles based on the company’s BladeCenter blade servers and two-processor x335 and x345 systems using Intel Corp.’s 32-bit Xeon chips.</p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">Clusters comprise multiple servers tied together to create a supercomputer.</p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">In a related announcement in Corning, N.Y., IBM last week announced that it was teaming with Corning Inc., the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration to develop high-speed, optically switched interconnects for supercomputers. The $20 million, two-and-a-half-year project is aimed at increasing network bandwidth by 50 times while at the same time cutting the costs of supercomputers.</p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">IBM’s 325 systems, powered by 2GHz Opterons, give users a chance to run both their 32-bit and 64-bit applications on a single platform, which is important for mixed-use environments, said David Turek, vice president of IBM’s Deep Computing unit.</p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">“For many of these users, who have been left with a stark choice—you either run 32-bit or 64-bit—Opteron is an interesting bridge between the two,” Turek said. “It’s an attractive proposition.”</p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">AMD, of Sunnyvale, Calif., has pushed Opteron’s ability to run 32-bit applications as well as it does 64-bit applications as a key differentiator between it and Intel’s Itanium architecture. The 64-bit Itanium chip maintains a limited amount of backward compatibility, which means that it does not run the 32-bit applications as well as it does the 64-bit software.</p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">With the latest Itanium 2 released this summer, officials with Intel, of Santa Clara, Calif., were promoting the company’s IA-32 Execution Layer, designed to bridge that performance gap. Intel, which has pushed Xeon-based systems for 32-bit applications and Itanium for 64-bit computing, views the execution layer as a way of helping customers who want to move to 64-bit computing but still have older 32-bit applications running.</p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">On Monday, Intel officials said that a software update from Microsoft Corp. that includes the execution layer for Windows applications has been delayed until the second half of next year. However, they said that Linux vendors, including <a href="https://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/Red-Hat-Cans-Linux-Distribution/" class="text-blue-500">Red Hat Inc.</a> and <a href="https://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/Novell-to-Buy-SuSE-Linux-for-210-Million/" class="text-blue-500">SuSE Linux AG</a>, both are incorporating the execution layer code in their offerings.</p>
