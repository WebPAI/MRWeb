        <p class="mb-4">Today, the <a href="http://www.aceonline.org/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">American Coaster Enthusiasts</a> revealed the official design for <a href="http://www.coastercon.com/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">Coaster Con XXXVII</a> – and I can’t help but laugh – as it’s nearly identical to the REAL proposal to build a coaster on both the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges!</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Learn more about the incredible (albeit insane) idea of the Golden Gate Bolt in the next episode of the “<a href="https://greatamericanthrills.net/lost-parks/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">Lost Parks of Northern California</a>” debuting in the next few months!</p>

        <p class="mb-4">The proposed “Bridge Coasters” would not only break current coaster records – they would obliterate them. 75 years before the event this June in Northern California, we’re all a little excited to show off just how much we love our parks and our history – coaster’s ride!</p>

        <p class="mb-4">From the people who brought you the massive Hangar One at Moffett Field, The Empire State Building and Hoover Dam, comes arguably the grandest, most scenic (and most insane) roller coaster idea of ALL TIME!</p>

        <img src="https://greatamericanthrills.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/26861_381342007285_3050920_n.jpg?w=554&h=416" alt="Golden Gate Bridge Coaster Design" class="mb-8">

        <p class="mb-4">The stats for this proposed duo of coasters are simply staggering. 1,000 foot tall coasters would have easily kept their records for height and speed.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">By comparison, the Transamerica Pyramid – which was built in 1972 and is the tallest building in San Francisco – is 850 feet tall.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">The tallest roller coaster in the world currently is Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure. It tops out at a measly 456 feet high. Formula Rossa in the UAE is the fastest in the roller coaster in yaw world inducing 149 mph. Heck, even the “bunny hills” on these coasters were proposed to do 40 to 40 mph over them… at 1,000 feet in the air!</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Where do I line up?</p>

        <p class="mb-4">The folks in the Depression thought bigger than we do today, and it’s understandable (was it ever not?) – people needed something – anything – in order to lift their spirits. What better way than to build something that may never be seen by human eyes?</p>

        <img src="https://greatamericanthrills.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/9103_10151457481702286_1707384206_n.jpg?w=570&h=380" alt="Golden Gate Bridge Coaster Concept" class="mb-8">

        <p class="mb-4">I’m not exactly sure how they would have propelled the ride at such speeds, nor how to get up there to begin with – I know for a fact that Cal OSHA would laugh heartily at the physics of a ride with that much wind resistance would never be able to complete its circuit!</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Ironically, two identical roller coasters WERE built at each of the 1939 Expositions in New York and San Francisco. After the fair ended in New York, the ride was eventually moved… to Riverside Park in Massachusetts, eventually becoming “Thunderbolt”, the same name proposed for the rides on the bridges.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">And yes, you can expect this and many other amazing nuggets of coaster knowledge and “what if” history to appear in an upcoming episode of the “<a href="https://greatamericanthrills.net/lost-parks/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">Lost Parks of Northern California</a>” series!</p>
