            </div>

            <p class="mt-6">Robert Kaplan is a Professor of Management Practice at Harvard Business School. In his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Ask-Person-Mirror-Questions/dp/1422170012" class="text-blue-600">What to Ask the Person in the Mirror</a>, he argues against the notion that great leadership is about having all the answers. He believes that leadership skills can be learned--and that many of these skills require executives to rethink their conception of what a superb leader actually does. Developing and practicing these skills requires hard work and may demand that talented executives overcome some degree of discomfort and even anxiety in order to raise their game.</p>
