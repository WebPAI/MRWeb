            <p class="mt-8">As wonderful as reading is, there are pitfalls to being a literate
                human. Never fear, I’m not going to put down the obviously reading can sometimes be a reading. The
                following are 10 disadvantages of being a bookworm and how to “fix” them.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">1. BOOKS CAN LOOK MESSY</h2>

            <p class="mt-4">When you own so many books, they can take over every nook and cranny. Although <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375851569/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=sidetra-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0375851569&linkId=9f228d8f237d296cc4884a91ca2184bf" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Dr. Seuss</a> would be
                delighted about it, it can be incredibly uncomfortable to get lost in your reality. While some of us like the room
                filled with “cluttered” with books and possibly disorganized and messy looking, it is preferable being
                organized as in the above image. However, you still need to make sure your matter how organized your books are. Check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GSTHBQS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=sidetra-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00GSTHBQS&linkId=843365cc550d527d4dd30df95f51b49f" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Hoarding: Buried Alive</a> for some extreme examples.</p>

            <p class="mt-4">Solution: There are thousands of book organization tips and advice. If you own too many of the
                inconveniently sized book, you can buy book boxes, free up space and clear clutter, or you can try one of the
                following tips in books, your shelves, or even have a yard book sale.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">2. READING CAN BE LONELY</h2>

            <p class="mt-4">Sometimes we bookworms prefer the company of paper, ink, and our imaginations over the company of
                real people. And that’s okay for some of the time. But there are times when you feel you need to at least
                pretend to be a people person so it’s easier to meet more people who share your particular reading
                interests.</p>

            <p class="mt-4">Solution: Find others who share your affinity for reading by joining a reading <a href="https://www.amreading.com/2016/11/18/5-amazing-youtube-book-clubs-for-the-digital-age/" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">book club</a>, make friends
                with your local <a href="https://www.amreading.com/2017/01/05/florida-librarians-fabricated-data-to-keep-thousands-of-books-in-circulation/" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">librarians</a> who love books and are usually really cool, or put down the book
                you’re latter and talk to people about what you’re interested in. You do have other interests, right?
                Well, if you don’t, you can try developing some. Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JenTHGyA2V8" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">YouTube</a> video for some ideas.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">3. LESS TIME FOR "BEING COOL"</h2>

            <p class="mt-4">When you spend your free time reading, you don’t watch shows that everyone talks about. “Trust me, my
                own experience. I end up just sitting there with a blank expression on my face and feeling duck. And
                sometimes I do people have enough time to watch all those different shows?

            <p class="mt-4">Solution: You have to be able to allow yourself to read and watch TV (and all of your personal
                reading habits, and spend less money on new releases) quickly to change as you get older, your lifestyle,
                right? As a spectator, my job is to show you can completely change, if everybody’s fashionable
                because there are 24 hours in a day and you’re not going to let that change you. You can always find and
                join your team, and co-workers. Yes, I’m going to advise you to fake it or bluff as best as you can. Or if you
                just don’t care about that, then you’re a book lover and there’s nothing wrong with being yourself. It’s your
                very own belief, after all, and it’s your mental state of mind.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">4. LACK OF SLEEP</h2>

            <p class="mt-4">You can’t help yourself but finish that book you’ve been dying to read. In the morning you wake
                up with bloodshot eyes, bags under your eyes, and you haven’t even had your coffee yet. You still need to do the adult
                day, drive, work, take care of kids, etc.</p>

            <img src="https://www.amreading.com/wp-content/uploads/Woman-Read-Night-B.jpg" alt="" class="mt-8 w-full">

            <p class="mt-4">Solution: There are so many ways to make sure you have a better sleep. Take a hot bath or shower, and
                stretch. A warm bath is one way to do it, as is a warm shower. You can turn off the light or use a dimmer, and
                relax in the night. The book will still be there in the next day. Go to sleep. Believe me, I know how to
                recover from there.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">5. INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVEN’T READ WHAT
                YOU HAVE</h2>

            <p class="mt-4">Definitively you have some several different opinions, even if you don’t know those people have similar interests.
                When you’re a fan of a book or an author, you don’t have a book party. But sometimes you want to play “
                devil’s advocate” and compare people’s tastes and share your reading tastes. Check out this Pinterest image: <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/489696159453266061/" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">annoyed face</a>.</p>

            <p class="mt-4">Solution: You generally don’t have to share what you read to others. So one of my other things I have like
                to do, besides from the regular standard material that I like to read is drawing. My dream and fantasy were filled
                with conversations with my family, but I don’t have any trouble making myself prefer. No, I can’t have some of
                my own literary quotes with my family, however hard I would squeeze them. There are still all kind of weird in
                my ideas. Check out this Pinterest image: <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/489696159453266061/" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">happy extended family</a>.</p>

            <p class="mt-4">Well, let’s talk about one that is a lot tougher to handle. How do you interact with people who don’t like
                to read much at all? These comments and conversations can make you feel like you’ve been punched in
                the gut.</p>

            <img src="https://www.amreading.com/wp-content/uploads/annoyed-face.jpg" alt="" class="mt-8 w-full">
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2 text-sm">Source: <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/489696159453266061/" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Pinterest</a></p>

            <p class="mt-4">Solution: I’m lucky enough that I haven’t really encountered this too much in my family. And I know some
                people who fit this description on the “Terror” category. I think they identify that I like to read and write
                comments about the books I really love. I only have one piece of advice–don’t bother. Besides, as the
                culinary scene of paper books to wonder around, so you won’t feel bad.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">6. THE MOVIE VERSION</h2>

            <p class="mt-4">That dreaded moment when you see that a book you love is going to be made into a <a href="https://www.amreading.com/2017/01/04/book-to-screen-12-adaptations-that-should-be-on-your-radar-in-2017/" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">movie</a>. Yes, you are filled
                with anticipation and apprehension. Are they going to follow the book or at least stay true to the spirit of
                the book or will they change everything? The movie version is an entirely unnerving experience if it’s a
                discorded fan of the book.

            <img src="https://www.amreading.com/wp-content/uploads/movie1.jpg" alt="" class="mt-8 w-full">
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2 text-sm">Source: <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/video/clip-12386708-stock-footage-a-fan-movie-male-watching-a-movie-story-cinema-entertainment-and-people-concept-happy-friends.html?src=rel/12386744:1/gg" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Shutterstock</a></p>

            <p class="mt-4">Solution: Sometimes adaptations are a deserved. But other times, the movie does the book justice and even
                enhances our love of the text. When a movie adaptation of a book, I usually go with my two sons
                of experience watching how my sons get personal experience. If the movie sucks or I suspect that the
                screenwriters have had one too many drinks while changing the entire script, as in my own decades from the
                Philippines as I had my own work, some other plans, and I thought providing. If the movie deserves a right
                book, I only ask myself whether I usually change my personally ingrained or disappointed hand, as in right
                reasonably objective reputations, based on my emotional connection to the book.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">7. CHOOSING FAVORITES</h2>

            <p class="mt-4">What is your favorite book? I am asked this question so much, not any time I say that I love to read, people ask
                me. I hem and haw. Check out these <a href="http://www.asherwitmer.com/10-quotes-that-make-you-think-about-your-walk-with-god/" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">quotes</a>.</p>

            <p class="mt-4">Solution: I usually just tell the person, I like to read and these were examples as such in this time I’ve
                finished reading books (10 minutes later, the person who asked me usually walks away before I finish.)</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">8. MONEY FOR BOOKS</h2>

            <p class="mt-4">Beyond any <a href="https://www.amreading.com/2017/01/07/video-the-secret-library-a-book-lovers-journey-through-curiosities-of-history/" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">library</a>, you probably have everything else in your life. When you collect as hard books as me, a
                regular habit, you probably have to make room in the monthly budget for new books. What are you have to
                choose between: food or books? It’s a toss-up. Check out these books with money in the background: <a href="http://mtstmary.schoolfusion.us/modules/cms/pages.phtml?pageid=269953" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">books with money</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">9. CONFUSING FEELINGS</h2>

            <p class="mt-4">You desperately want to know the ending, but you don’t want to end the book. You love going to a
                bookstore but you feel the pain of your purse when you pay for books. You both have sad and happy feelings
                because you make they want to feel sad, but you want the characters to be happy. Check out this image: <a href="http://www.richlymiddleclass.com/lies-men-hate/happy-and-sad/" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">young reading happy sad</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">10. ESCAPISM CAN GO SOUTH</h2>

            <p class="mt-4">Bookworms are not all created equal. I’ve read the entire story of how someone lives through reading. However,
                virtually reading the book isn’t the best way. I’ve also read about the lies and sometimes less-than-ideal living
                situations by getting away with other people’s lives through books. I wished I could read more and more
                interesting, but I’m too addicted. I can’t even imagine myself reading a good book doing nothing than to enter
                the story of a book constantly and never return to reality. It can be a slippery slope. Check out this image: <a href="https://www.wallpaperup.com/430350/book_maze_macro_photoshop_psychedelic_fantasy.html" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">book maze</a>.</p>

            <p class="mt-4">Solution: We are going to keep reading just as we should, but we should instead of enjoying life through the stories
                of others’ lives alone, let’s try to make our own lives a little more meaningful, a little more successful so that
                returning to reality won’t be so awful. I know how to handle them from now on. I’m still working on this
                myself.</p>
