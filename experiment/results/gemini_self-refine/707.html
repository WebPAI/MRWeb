        <p class="mb-4">Censorship of the press is considered a heinous crime but even by those political parties who would cheerfully see the UK emulate North Korea in all manner of things.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Can you imagine the outcry if Oxfordshire County Council announced that you could no longer read the Guardian in their public libraries because they disliked an article published therein? Would twitter be similarly outraged, or questions raised in parliament?</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Yet just this week a similar fate has befallen two bloggers and the silence is deafening – even from within the blogosphere.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="mb-4">The blog <a href="http://nutsville.com/?p=2466" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">‘Nutsville’</a> run by Tory party Westminster Council candidate Peter Large. Quote apart from the usual areas of debate for political activists, circulars to the web host alleging them to be racist, etc – the council have blocked the entire site. Being a council which presumes to provide public libraries, <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/suppressing_unfavourable_politic" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">The FOI request</a> that has been sent to the council by the 15<sup>th</sup> February to produce the notice – and proof of a material breach by violation of The Human Rights Act 1998, Article 10, Freedom of Expression – must be answered by the 25<sup>th</sup> and may be the start of putting other state (or in particular) council censorship in the spotlight.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">You may want to read the full story on <a href="https://martinbrookes.blogspot.com/2011/01/internet-censorship-in-peoples-republic.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Martin Brookes,</a> who runs one</p>
        <p class="mb-4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Up in Scotland, a similar fate has befallen <a href="https://caedmonscat.blogspot.com/" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Caedmon’s<br />Cat</a> whose operator is also active in reporting local Council. He too, we are told, has his site completely blocked in public libraries.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="mb-4">If a site contained libellous or defamatory material, then legal action is perfectly acceptable by those that it libels – and bloggers should have to comply with the law. However, local councils blocking entire sites which they object to from being read by the general public is outrageous, and any such defamation has been shown to occur in articles about all manner of people.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Why is this considered acceptable against bloggers but would be a matter of outrage against the main stream media?</p>
        <p class="mb-4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Is anyone else aware of other instances of bloggers being censored in this way?</p>
        <p class="mb-4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Do any of you have the time to drop a FOI into your local council’s IT department to see how wide spread this practice is, and which blogs are involved so that we can get a picture of what is happening country wide?</p>
        <p class="mb-4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="mb-4">We are owed an list as to what the idiot, politically correct army of local councils, that have been given the right to decide what we read.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">This seems to be a very grey thing between the blogger and the Rutland County Council. If you read the posts, as far as I can gather he emailed an ex-councillor who then told all the other members of the Council. It would seem that the Rutland Council wouldn’t have noticed if he hadn’t tried</p>
        <p class="mb-4">all kinds of things to stop him having a voice on his blog and have banned him there must be something in it. Something he is saying that the threatened. Maybe if it is the truth, they would be better off letting the Council is secretive at best and worst there is something sinister going on. Whatever is happening this is one time when there should be more not less doesn’t break the law. The people in the area deserve to know what is going on. It is up to them to decide if what is right in this fight.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Herein lies the crux of things. I don’t have any great disagreements with you, even though I have to say, I support the stance of the council as well, up to a point. The point is, if you disagree with someone, or a publicly entered body (as in this case) then you can openly and voiceably disagree. I guess it is a fine line and I think we have to tolerate it, in a society tolerating free speech. You have your voice on any other website, or even write to the council to ask them for their reasoning. By putting it up publicly, what choice does that leave them but to supposedly censoring you and be taken to court, if you don’t take kindly to them not reading it. I happen to be a firm believer of common sense prevailing, and politely put, I’ve had problems with others, on very different, non-political subjects, that although I don’t have any specific instructions, honestly don’t think they’d like me lambasting, as it begrudges others, and I have to disagree with you, with all due respect.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">From Public Libraries have been blocking selective blogs since 2000, to my certain knowledge, in others in the UK. If you want to blog but never see certain libraries in my experience.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">The state doesn’t have to provide a free internet connection for you to exercise your “freedom of expression”. However if it does provide it it shouldn’t censor it.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="mb-4">If this is a case of some nervous woman, then 99% of the internet will need to be banned leading to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scunthorpe_problem" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">“clbuttic”</a> issues.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="mb-4">If this is a case of some disagreement then the council should follow proper legal channels to stop it such as suing. People still read the blog elsewhere so banning it in a library just means those who valued a PC or net connection in the library because it was bigger and smaller and snaffler proportion of the population. In other words reflexive.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="mb-4">If it’s only a single person on the council who is affect by the bloggers comments then the council using its power to ban the blog is pretty much malfeasance in public office.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">No, that would annoy other people in the library. More like you can go into a library and read a book written by Alistair Campbell or Hitler or Mao but read it without the library trying to stop you by not allowed.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Libraries do need to tread on eggshells, they are caught by the ‘dissemination’ element of the tort. On first blush, one point of distributing. I don’t know, I haven’t looked, and although I’m not bond anything I would certain. I believe libraries are, at least, at risk.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">I have not researched the law, but if a library has been made aware that a particular web site contains allegedly defamatory material, wouldn’t it leave itself open to a claim in defamation if it failed to block the site?</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Maybe the Guardian will do a better job next time, since it violates basic human rights, freedoms of speech and diversity of views, all those things the left bang on about. Obviously maybe WGD MSN is so much outright lies on his site they will formally stress.
