                    <p class="font-bold text-lg mb-4">SHEM Guiding Principles & Purposes</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                        <li>To fulfill the Lord's command to help the poor and needy wherever and however possible.</li>
                        <li>To act as a clearinghouse for those people with emergency needs.</li>
                        <li>To refer people with particular problems to other government or private helping agencies, which are set up to more adequately handle their special needs</li>
                        <li>To help those people especially who fall through the cracks, or in some way do not qualify for help from other normal helping agencies.</li>
                        <li>To provide outlets for area churches, their members, community groups and organizations to assist the needy through SHEM by offering their prayers, financial aid, volunteer services, general or specific resources or abilities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="font-bold text-lg mt-8 mb-4">We are...</p>
                    <p>Our SHEM Board is comprised of not more than 15 members total, including pastoral representatives; four or more laypersons and one volunteer staff representative. All of the work completed at SHEM Food Pantry and SHEM Manna is through the caring and efficient efforts of our dedicated volunteer staff.</p>
                    <p class="font-bold text-lg mt-8 mb-4">SHEM Foodbank Volunteer Staff:</p>
                    <p>Community members volunteering at SHEM are making a huge impact and committed investment in the lives, welfare and future of thousands in our community. Ongoing programs sponsored by SHEM address many critical needs in the community, which facilitate and support a healthier and higher quality living environment.</p>
                    <p class="font-bold text-lg mt-8 mb-4">Primary Focus & Mission</p>
                    <p>Funding to address hunger and need in Sweet Home is received from the United Way, FEMA, various grants, local churches, as well as community support of both monetary donations and gifts in-kind.</p>
                    <p>SHEM distributes an emergency food box once a month, containing enough nutritious food for three meals a day to feed a family for four days. SHEM also sponsors a meal site program, (ie Manna) which offers free meals three nights on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday evenings at 5 pm at the United Methodist Church at 6th and Ironwood. This meal site welcomes the homeless, elderly and those who need help in stretching their budget or just wishing to share a meal with fellow compainions.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the programs providing hunger relief, SHEM also serves as the Salvation Army Extension Unit for Sweet Home and facilitates programs for financial assistance for utilities and emergency lodging. SHEM offers supplies to the homeless population in our community and maintains a free clothing closet. SHEM also assists families whose homes have been destroyed by fire by providing bedding, clothing and household items.</p>
                    <p>Volunteers operate a limited system of home delivery for shut-ins and those without transportation. SHEM coordinates a community-wide Christmas basket program and a Back-to-School Celebration, which provides not only a welcomed holiday meal but also backpacks and school supplies for needy school-aged children.</p>
                    <p>SHEM has been located in numerous sites during its 30 years of existence, but through determined fundraising efforts and careful stewardship, we are now in our permanent home onsite at 1115 Long Street in Sweet Home.</p>
                    <p class="font-bold text-lg mt-8 mb-4">Statement of Values & Guiding Principles:</p>
                    <p class="font-bold text-lg mb-4">Respect</p>
                    <p>We respect the inherent worth and dignity of every person and treat all with justice, equity and compassion. We honor the lives, concerns and stories of people in need and expect our partners to do the same. We accept one another and encourage diversity of thoughts and ideas. We believe that the ethnic, cultural and social diversity of our nation should be reflected in our staff, Board and network.</p>
                    <p class="font-bold text-lg mt-8 mb-4">Stewardship and Accountability</p>
                    <p class="font-bold text-lg mb-4">Collaboration</p>
                    <p>We keep faith with the public trust through the efficient and compassionate use of resources entrusted to us and are mindful that our mission is accomplished through the generosity of others. We maintain and communicate accurate and timely information on hunger research, education, advocacy and service. We evaluate and account regularly for how resources are used to implement and achieve our mission.</p>
                    <p>We believe in the power of community. We collaborate and build strong relationships, based on trust, with and among those who share our vision of creating a hunger-free America. We work together to accomplish the vision at the national and local levels, valuing each other's roles and using an open process and honest communication. We seek out and are responsive to the input and counsel of our community partners.</p>
                    <p class="font-bold text-lg mt-8 mb-4">Service</p>
                    <p>We believe service to others is fundamental to creating a hunger-free America. We serve with excellence, compassion and responsiveness to meet the needs of those with whom we work, internally and externally.</p>
                    <p class="font-bold text-lg mt-8 mb-4">Integrity</p>
                    <p>We act with honesty, trust and openness and deliver on our commitments. We act within the spirit of agreements, contracts and the law. Our intentions and actions are transparent and above reproach.</p>
                    <p class="font-bold text-lg mt-8 mb-4">Staff and Volunteers</p>
                    <p>Our staff and volunteers are critical to our ability to meet SHEM'S mission and will be treated with dignity and respect as valuable colleagues. Staff and Volunteers will be given clear understanding of the mission of the organization, job definitions and expectations.</p>
                    <p class="font-bold text-lg mt-8 mb-4">Leadership</p>
                    <p>SHEM recognizes its leadership role in alleviating hunger in the community. Our volunteer Board Members are committed to the highest standards of professional ethics, integrity, lawfulness and responsibility. Board Members are entrusted with the wellbeing of the organization and demonstrate the highest integrity and leadership on behalf of the organization.</p>
                    <p class="font-bold text-lg mt-8 mb-4">Advocacy</p>
                    <p>SHEM will conduct all activities in a manner that brings the greatest attention possible to the problems of hunger in our community. We actively collaborate and participate in community projects to ensure achievement of our mission and the clients we serve.</p>
