            One of the advantages of being <a href="http://wp.me/p1jg1T-1Dg" class="text-gray-600">a perpetual student</a> is spring break. At my new school of Art, we have two spring breaks: one because the school is old and we are still disposing of building heat in the month of November; and one in spring. I took our excursion to Toulouse two years ago in November, and I wish I could point to my time spent in southeastern France, weekend trips included, to show you around. But I can always remember Toulouse.  Thanks again to <a href="http://wp.me/P1jg1T-1ug" class="text-gray-600">Michel</a>.

            Toulouse is situated in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute-Garonne" class="text-gray-600">Haute-Garonne</a> department of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midi-Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es" class="text-gray-600">Midi-Pyrénées</a> region of France. About 160 miles from the Atlantic Ocean, 300 miles from the Mediterranean, and 400 miles from Paris, with a metro population of over 800,000, the fourth largest city in metropolitan France. Toulouse is the fourth largest city in France and the fourth largest metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille. It is the presiding metropolis of its region and owes much of its popularity to the age of Toulouse as an old university town. Since the Middle Ages of France and the two companies building the A380 (<a href="http://www.airbus.com/" class="text-gray-600">Airbus</a> of France Center, one of the largest assembly halls in Europe), the <a href="http://en.univ-toulouse.fr/our-strengths" class="text-gray-600">University of Toulouse</a> is one of the most well-known university systems and research centers in the world. With nearly 125,000 students in Toulouse, as well as many internationally focused schools, one weekend trip can attract almost any student spending a duration in France or other European cities. In fact, the personal opinion that Toulouse is one of the best cities to spend your student vacation in France.
