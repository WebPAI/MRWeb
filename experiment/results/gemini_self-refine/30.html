            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Leak Detection</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">The first step we recommend in determining if you have a leak, is to test the toilets. It is possible to have a silent leak (one
                that you don't see or hear) and lose up to 200 gallons per day. It could be caused by the flapper, which is the large rubber plug in
                the tank. The tank is the back of the toilet where the unused water for the bowl is stored. To check for this type of toilet leak:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                <li>Remove the lid from the tank</li>
                <li>Pour enough food coloring in the tank to change the color of the water (powedered drink mixes can also be used)</li>
                <li>Wait 20 - 30 minutes, WITHOUT FLUSHING</li>
                <li>Check the bowl of the toilet</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4">If the colored water has seaped through to the bowl, there is a leak</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Consider replacing the flapper and inspect the inside of the tank to see if there is any build-up preventing a proper seal. Also
                inspect the lift wire/guide to see if it is bent, corroded or catching on something, preventing the flapper from closing properly.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">If the colored water does NOT come through to the bowl, there can still be a problem with the toilet. Another possible problem could be with the water leaking into the overflow pipe. Adjustments may need to be made. To check for this type of toilet leak:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                <li>Pour some powder or pepper into the tank, along the sides</li>
                <li>If it moves toward the center of the tank, there is a leak</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The float arm needs to be adjusted so that the water level is 2" below the top of the overflow pipe. The float arm may need to be repositioned to obtain the desired water level. If it is a plastic float arm, adjust the screw located at the top of the arm. Also make sure the refill tube is located about 1/4" over the overflow pipe. If necessary, clip the tube to the overflow pipe to stabilize it and keep it from moving into the overflow pipe.</p>

            <p class="font-bold mt-4">The next step for leak detection should be inspecting the service line.</p> <p>This is the line that runs from the meter pit to the home. It is possible to have a leak in the line and not have any signs of it above ground. There may not be a wet spot. To check for a leak in the service line:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                <li>Turn off the shut-off valve at the home, so that no water will be going into the home</li>
                <li>Gently lift the lid to the meter, being mindful of the wires attached to the electronic equipment (an adjustable wrench may be needed to loosen the bolt on the lid)</li>
                <li>Locate the dials on the meter</li>
                <li>Note the position of the dials and write down the numbers as they are displayed</li>
                <li>Wait about 45 minutes</li>
                <li>Check the dials on the meter again</li>
                <li>If the numbers have changed or if there has been movement on the dials, there is a leak</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Consider replacing or repairing the service line to prevent larger loss of water. A professional service may need to be contacted for completing this task.</p>

            <p class="font-bold mt-4">The next step for leak detection should be monitoring usage inside the home.</p> <p>Immediately following the above test of the service line, if there was no change on the dials, do the following:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                <li>Go back to the shut-off valve at the home and open it back up so that water will now be flowing into the home</li>
                <li>Verify that all faucets are off and no appliances that use water are running (water softeners, dishwashers, laundry washing machines, ice makers, etc...)</li>
                <li>With the lid to the meter still lifted, verify the position and numbers on the dials are still unchanged from the previous test</li>
                <li>Wait about 45 minutes</li>
                <li>Check the dials on the meter again</li>
                <li>If the numbers have changed or if there has been movement on the dials, there is a leak</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At this point, try to determine where the water is going inside the home.</p>

            <p class="font-bold mt-4">Finally, if all of the above tests show no evidence of leaked water, check the appliances that cycle.</p> <p>Water softeners can cause an increase in usage, so check the settings to make sure it is not cycling more often than necessary and monitor its full cycle to make sure it is operating properly. Also check outside spigots and hydrants to make sure they are not dripping, especially when connected to a sprinkler, soaker hose, or irrigation system. Take note of the times when extra water may be used, possibly weekends and evenings, when watering plants and gardens.</p>

            <p class="font-bold mt-4">Below are some leak facts to help determine how much water is being lost:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                <li>1 drop per second adds up to 7 gallons per day</li>
                <li>a steady drip becomes 20 gallons per day</li>
                <li>a trickle can accumulate up to 200 gallons per day</li>
                <li>a silent leak in a toilet can lose 200 gallons per day, or 6000 gallons per month</li>
            </ul>
