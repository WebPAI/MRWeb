                <p class="mb-4">Del Sol throughout the spring and summer 2018 season has had the great privilege of supporting the Mauli Ola Foundation in their efforts to introduce surfing as a natural treatment to people (especially children) with genetic disorders.</p>

                </div>

                <p class="mb-4">The Mauli Ola Foundation (MOF) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing hope and confidence to individuals living with genetic diseases. Harnessing the healing powers of the ocean, they introduce surfing and ocean-based activities as natural therapies, involving professional surfers and their sponsors in organized surf days.</p>

                <img src="http://www.delsol.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MOF_Hawaii_SurfDay_GroupPic_April2018.png" alt="Group Picture" class="w-full mb-8">

                <p class="mb-4">Group picture from this season’s Waikiki, Hawaii Surf Experience Day, featuring surf instructors and MOF volunteers. Hosted by professional surfers and native Hawaiians, Kala Alexander, Jimmy Ulualoha Napeahi.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">In 2007, Charles and James Dunlop found an article in the New England Journal of Medicine showing scientific support that ocean water provides natural therapy for people with Cystic Fibrosis, which ultimately inspired the creation of the Mauli Ola Foundation. Later that year, kids with CF joined pro surfer, Jamie O’Brien, and other surfers in Newport Beach, CA for a one-on-one surf lesson. Surfline posted an article about the event, and was well received by the surf community.</p>


                <p class="mb-4">After the huge response from the Surfline article, James and Charlie went to Hawaii to speak with professional surfer, Mick O’Brien, which led to a conversation with other surfers and influencers, further laying the groundwork for the Mauli Ola Foundation. Since then, the mission of “may the wave heal us all” has been spread to hundreds of surf events worldwide.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Del Sol has been honored to support this season’s Aloha Tour with hundreds of custom <a href="http://www.delsol.com/apparel.html" class="text-red-600">Del Sol color-changing shirts</a> for kids and custom shirts for surfers and MOF volunteers, along with Del Sol tote bags, beach toys, and custom polos for all surf instructors.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">Athletes and volunteers were also able to deliver hundreds of Del Sol color-changing products to children battling various genetic diseases at a number of hospital visits and surf events across the eastern, southern and western United States.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">This year, dozens of major professional surfers and wakeboarders, including Sunny Garcia, Teddy Navarro, Cheyne Magnusson, Jimmy Ulualoha Napeahi, and Austin Keen have been in great support of these events, which began in Honolulu, Hawaii in April and extended up and down the Pacific and Atlantic U.S. coastlines.</p>
