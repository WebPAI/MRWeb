                <p>Since people are risk-averse with respect to gain and risk-seeking with respect to loss, their choices can be easily manipulated by whether an offer is framed as a gain or a loss.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="mb-4">Suppose a rare disease would claim 600 lives if we did nothing. We are asked to choose between different policy options:</p>
            
            <p class="mb-2">A. 200 lives could be saved with certainty.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">B. 600 lives could be saved with 1/3 chance and 0 lives saved with 2/3 chance.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-4">Typically, 72% of us would choose option A even though the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="text-red-600">expected value¹</a> of option B is equivalent to option A.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-4">But if the policy options are as follows:</p>
            
            <p class="mb-2">C. 400 people would die with certainty.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">D. No one would die with 1/3 chance and 600 would die with 2/3 chance.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-6">Typically, 78% of us would choose option D even though the expected value of option D is equivalent to option C.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-6">Substantively, options A and C are identical and options B and D are identical. It is a case of whether we are viewing the glass as half empty or half full. In the first instance, "lives saved" is framed as a gain. People are instinctively <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="text-red-600">risk averse²</a> with respect to gain and are reluctant to gamble with a sure gain unless the risky gain is so much higher. In the second instance, "certain death" is framed as a loss. People are instinctively <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="text-red-600">risk seeking³</a> with respect to loss and are willing to gamble to reduce loss unless the risky loss is so much larger.</p>
