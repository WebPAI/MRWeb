                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The energetic youth of Franklin have teamed up with the Franklin Downtown Partnership to promote the Franklin Food Pantry during the "10 Days of Giving" campaign. All Franklinites are invited to help collect non-perishable food items to benefit the Franklin Food Pantry from December 1-10.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The Food Drive is a convenient way for Franklinites to give back to our local community. Residents can collect items in their own neighborhoods or at local participating businesses. The collected donations will be delivered to the Franklin Food Pantry on Saturday, December 14.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The Food Drive is a collaborative community service group made up of the youth of Franklin. They have teamed up with the Franklin Downtown Partnership to promote the "10 Days of Giving" campaign. During the past three years, the "10 Days of Giving" has collected and delivered more than 80,000 pounds of goods.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        "We are so proud of our local youth and excited that they are using their energy to help those who are less fortunate," said Executive Director, Lisa Piana.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        This year's campaign has been quite successful and we hope to raise even more than 80,000 pounds of goods.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        According to the Franklin Food Pantry, about 400 registered families use the Pantry services monthly. This translates to approximately 1,000 individuals served in Franklin each month.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">

                        All Downtown Partnership members have been invited to participate in the "10 Days of Giving" campaign. At the end of the ten days, the youth will weigh and load the collected food items onto trucks provided by the generosity of those businesses who are participating.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        "It's a busy time of year and we're working with this food drive to make donating easy and convenient," said Piana. "The partnership is pleased to support our local youth and encourage everyone to participate and help those in our community who need it most."
