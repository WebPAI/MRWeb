                <ul class="text-navy list-disc ml-6">
                    <li>To fulfill the Lord's command to help the poor and needy wherever and however possible.</li>
                    <li>To act as a clearinghouse for those people with emergency needs.</li>
                    <li>To refer people with particular problems to other government or private helping agencies, which are set up to more adequately handle their special needs</li>
                    <li>To help those people especially who fall through the cracks, or in some way do not qualify for help from other normal helping agencies.</li>
                    <li>To provide outlets for area churches, their members, community groups and organizations to assist the needy through SHEM by offering their prayers, financial aid, volunteer services, general or specific resources or abilities.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-navy font-bold text-lg mt-8 mb-2">We are...</h2>
                <p class="text-navy">Our SHEM Board is comprised of not more than 15 members total, including pastoral representatives; four or more laypersons and one volunteer staff representative. All of the work completed at SHEM Food Pantry and SHEM Manna is through the caring and efficient efforts of our dedicated volunteer staff.</p>

                <h2 class="text-navy font-bold text-lg mt-8 mb-2">SHEM Foodbank Volunteer Staff:</h2>
                <p class="text-navy">Community members volunteering at SHEM are making a huge impact and committed investment in the lives, welfare and future of thousands in our community. Ongoing programs sponsored by SHEM address many critical needs in the community, which facilitate and support a healthier and higher quality living environment.</p>

                <h2 class="text-navy font-bold text-lg mt-8 mb-2">Primary Focus & Mission</h2>
                <p class="text-navy">Funding to address hunger and need in Sweet Home is received from the United Way, FEMA, various grants, local churches, as well as community support of both monetary donations and gifts in-kind. <br><br> SHEM distributes an emergency food box once a month, containing enough nutritious food for three meals a day to feed a family for four days. SHEM also sponsors a meal site program, (ie Manna) which offers free meals three nights on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday evenings at 5 pm at the United Methodist Church at 6th and Ironwood. This meal site welcomes the homeless, elderly and those who need help in stretching their budget or just wishing to share a meal with fellow compainions. <br><br> In addition to the programs providing hunger relief, SHEM also serves as the Salvation Army Extension Unit for Sweet Home and facilitates programs for financial assistance for utilities and emergency lodging. SHEM offers supplies to the homeless population in our community and maintains a free clothing closet. SHEM also assists families whose homes have been destroyed by fire by providing bedding, clothing and household items. <br><br> Volunteers operate a limited system of home delivery for shut-ins and those without transportation. SHEM coordinates a community-wide Christmas basket program and a Back-to-School Celebration, which provides not only a welcomed holiday meal but also backpacks and school supplies for needy school-aged children. <br><br> SHEM has been located in numerous sites during its 30 years of existence, but through determined fundraising efforts and careful stewardship, we are now in our permanent home onsite at 1115 Long Street in Sweet Home.</p>

                <h2 class="text-navy font-bold text-lg mt-8 mb-2">Statement of Values & Guiding Principles:</h2>
