      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">6 Student Budget Places to Eat in Coventry</h1>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">You're probably a regular queuer at Subway. You cut out Domino's vouchers from the multiple voucher leaflets you collected on Freshers' Week, every week. When you wanna treat yourself, you might nip to Nandos. Who doesn't?! But there is more. Here's the lowdown on 6 student budget places to eat in Coventry!</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-500 mb-4">PHOENIX</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Realistically, you should know about the Phoenix by now, because of its most convenient of locations: right there on the corner across from the Hub. This is <span class="italic">the</span> student spot, and so the prices and menu reflect that. The atmosphere is easy going for a drink and their wings and burritos aren't bad either.</p>
      <img src="phoenix.jpg" alt="Phoenix" class="w-full mb-6">

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-500 mb-4">PASHA</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Turkish restaurant (although it's less of a restaurant given its size) Pasha is one many pass by and may not take notice of. Do not be one of these people. They make the food in front of you much like Subway, and they do some must-try wraps.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-500 mb-4">THE ESTABLISHMENT</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">While some might not know this exists, the likelihood is you've walked straight past a little gem heading into the City Centre. Located behind the cathedral, this swanky 'establishment' - an 18th century county hall/courtroom reflects its up-market image with higher prices and posher food. However, at lunchtimes, Monday to Fridays it's 2 for-1 on burgers. So for the same price as a Subway and without the Subway queues, you can feast on a meat and juicy burger with fries and coleslaw.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-500 mb-4">COSMO</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">A chain restaurant you may have seen in other UK cities, Cosmo is an all-you-can-eat buffet like no other. While going at lunchtime means less choice than in the evening, that doesn't impact on the quantity as, after all, that's up to and how much you can devour. Stack that plate up like the lecture handout pile growing on your desk in your room. Chinese and Indian cuisine on demand.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-500 mb-4">HABIBI</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Tucked away into the detached shops of Far Gosford Street is Habibi. Middle Eastern halal cuisine served in an exotic Bedouin tent and garden out back. Habibi was voted one of the best veggie restaurants in the entire city and also allows your to BYOB (Bring your own beer, or of course, whatever else you prefer). Seeing as you probably walk past it on a regular basis, seems rude not to give it a try.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-500 mb-4">NOODLE BAR</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">This is UnCOVered's holy grail. Noodle Bar, or as we have nicknamed it, 'Noody B'. You can get a succulent Chinese meal for a sweet low price. A generous bowl of quality food for literally £6/£7. Select a meat (or non-meat), a cooking style with vegetables/sauce and the type of noodles you want and then wait mere minutes. Prepared by the city's fastest chefs, your order will arrive sharpish, and you will be satisfied. You're welcome.</p>
