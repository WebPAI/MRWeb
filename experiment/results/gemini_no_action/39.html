        <p class="mb-4">IBM on Tuesday announced a prepackaged and pretested cluster that is powered by Advanced Micro Devices Inc.’s 64-bit Opteron processor.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">IBM, of Armonk, N.Y., is combining its Opteron-based eServer 325 server—which targets scientific and technical computing users—with systems management software and storage devices to offer a bundled package that can run Linux and Windows operating systems.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">The new offering, which will be available later this month or in early December, is part of IBM’s eServer Cluster 1350, which also includes bundles based on the company’s BladeCenter blade servers and two-processor x335 and x345 systems using Intel Corp.’s 32-bit Xeon chips.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Clusters comprise multiple servers tied together to create a supercomputer.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">IBM’s 325 systems, powered by 2GHz Opterons, give users a chance to run both their 32-bit and 64-bit applications on a single platform, which is important for mixed-use environments, said David Turek, vice president of IBM’s Deep Computing unit.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">“For many of these users, who have been left with a stark choice—you either run 32-bit or 64-bit—Opteron is an interesting bridge between the two,” Turek said. “It’s an attractive proposition.”</p>
