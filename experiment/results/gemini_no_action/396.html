        <p class="mb-4">Every attempt is made to create unique sites with original graphics which suit both the nature of the
            organization and the target audience. Ease of use, eye-catching colour, strategic use of web technology when
            appropriate all contribute to the inviting look of our webs.</p>
        <p class="mb-8">We work with a number of non-profit groups to create professional websites at reasonable rates, plus
            smaller commercial organizations. However, much of our work is done for corporations, many of whose webs are
            behind company firewalls, and therefore not available for public viewing. In those cases, a snapshot of the screen
            is given with any identifying logos removed.</p>
