      <p class="mb-4">Today, the <a href="#">American Coaster Enthusiasts</a> revealed the official design Coaster Con XXVII logo, courtesy of the <a href="#">American Coaster Enthusiasts</a> -- and I can't help but laugh -- as it's nearly identical to the REAL proposal to build a coaster on both the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges!</p>

      <p class="mb-4">With the event coming up this June in Northern California, we're all just a little excited to show off just how much we love our parks and our history -- coaster's ride!</p>

      <img src="golden-gate-coaster-drawing.jpg" alt="Golden Gate Coaster Drawing" class="float-left mr-4 mb-4">

      <p class="mb-4">From the people who brought you the massive Hanger One at Moffett Field, The Empire State Building and Hoover Dam, comes arguably the grandest, most scenic (and most insane) roller coaster idea of ALL TIME!</p>

      <img src="golden-gate-coaster-drawing-2.jpg" alt="Golden Gate Coaster Drawing 2" class="w-full mb-4">

      <p class="mb-4">The proposed "Bridge Coasters" would not only break current coaster records -- they would obliterate them. 75 years before the records were even set! Photo from the California State Archive</p>

      <p class="mb-4">The stats for this proposed duo of coasters are simply staggering. 1,000 foot tall -- 750 foot drops -- a 190 mph top speed. Even by today's standards, these two coasters would have easily kept their records for height and speed.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">By comparison, the Transamerica Pyramid -- which was built in 1972 and is the tallest building in San Francisco -- is 850 feet tall.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">The tallest roller coaster currently currently is Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure. It tops out at a measly 456 feet high. Formula Rossa in the UAE is the fastest in the world, at a yawn inducing 149 mph. Heck, even the "bunny hills" on these coasters were proposed to do 40 to 40 mph over them... at 1,000 feet in the air!</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Where do I line up?</p>

      <p class="mb-4">The folks in the Depression sure thought bigger than we do today, and it's understandable (and may it never be) seen by human eyes -- people needed something -- anything -- in order to lift their spirits. What better way than to build something that was not only never attempted before, but was unimaginable?</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Double the height of Kingda Ka, and it would still wouldn't be as tall as the proposed "Golden Gate Thunderbolt" roller coaster!</p>

      <p class="mb-4">I'm not exactly sure how they would have propelled the ride at such speeds, nor am I sure how the physics of it would have worked. I mean, you've got to get it up there to begin with -- I know for a fact that Cal OSHA would laugh clearly at the physics of a ride with that much wind resistance would never be able to complete its circuit!</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Ironically, two identical roller coasters WERE built at each of the 1939 Expositions in New York and San Francisco. After the fair ended in New York, the ride was eventually moved... to Riverside Park in Massachusetts, eventually becoming "Thunderbolt," the same name proposed for the rides on the bridges.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">And yes, you can expect this and many other amazing nuggets of coaster knowledge and "what if" history to appear in an upcoming episode of the "Lost Parks of Northern California" series!</p>
