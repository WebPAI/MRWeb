            <p class="mb-2">by Anna Raccoon on February 3, 2011</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Censorship of the press is considered a heinous crime but even by those political parties who would cheerfully see the UK emulate North Korea in all manner of things.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Can you imagine the outcry if Oxfordshire County Council announced that you could no longer read the Guardian in their public libraries because they disliked an article just published there? Neither would journalists formally question, or parliament raise it.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Yet just this week a similar fate has befallen two bloggers at the click of a deadline – even from within the blogosphere.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">The blogquote “NoJustice” has put the Oxfordshire Council and its legal Peter Large. Quote apart from the usual stream of public information, circulars, demands that the web host takes them to court, etc – they have now blocked the entire site from being read on council premises, which include public libraries. The FOI request that has been sent to the council asks for the reasons behind this move – and pointing out that it may be a partial violation of The Human Rights Act 1998, (Article 10, Freedom of Expression) – meant to be enacted by 25<sup>th</sup> February and to protect all other forms of periodical or website, which council staff should be aware of.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">You may want to read the full story on <a href="#" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">NoJustice’s own site</a>.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Up in Rutland, a similar fate has befallen <a href="#" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Martin Brookes</a>, who operates a more national reporting local Rutland Council. He too, we now read, also has his site blocked in public libraries.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">If a site contained libelous or defamatory material, then blocking it from being accessible by one & all (like bloggers do) before any court case has been won with the law. However, local councils blocking an entire website of legal blogs is perfectly fine according to these public libraries, and any such defamation should be shown to occur in another article all together.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Why is this considered acceptable for bloggers but would be a matter of outrage if practised against the main stream media?</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Is anyone else aware of instances of bloggers being censored in this way?</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Do any of you have the time to drop a FOI into your local council’s IT department to see how wide spread this practice is, and which blogs are involved so that we can get a picture of what is happening country wide?</p>

            <p class="mb-4">We need to nip this in the bud. Public libraries may be run by local councils, but that doesn’t give them the right to decide what we read.</p>

                <p>My MP has replied to my email highlighting my concerns about this. She isn’t aware of this happening within her constituency… but didn’t give me some enquiries about it with colleagues…</p>

                <p>This seems to be a very grey thing between the blogger and the Rutland County Council. If you read the posts, as far as I can gather it was an ex-councillor who put the leaflet in that the other members of the Council would seem to have been unaware of. Something else to consider here is if you read all kinds of things on a blog how can you say that they have banned ‘just’ that one? Maybe a step too far in saying he is being banned from the libraries? I haven’t been in one myself for a while, but you get the picture that there must be something in the way they would be worded that the Council is assertive it has been worse than it has. It should never have been hung up. Whatever is happening this is something that seems more sinister doesn’t it? It is up to the people in the area who are aware what is going on. It is up to them to decide if what is right in this fight.</p>

                <p>Herein lies the crux of things. I don’t have any great disagreement, even though I have to say, I disagree with you with the other comments up to this point. The point is, free speech doesn’t agree with us, well, to a tolerable extent, I guess if you look at what you can and cannot say. It is a society balancing right. Of late, I don’t think we have voted on any specific website, or writer to fall outside those tolerances, but for someone trying to print on any council premise what they see is acceptable on any other website, is up to the owner of that device to decide for themselves. One can’t really complain and be taken seriously, if one does not take some something to read themselves. It happens in offices of course, with personally owned hardware, that we put up with others, with very specific instructions, honestly don’t think they are listening. I am inclined to begrudge it, as others are and I have to disagree with you, with all due respect.</p>

                <p>From what I know, libraries have been blocking selective blogs since 2000, to my certain knowledge, as have others in the UK. If you want to blog but bother not non-public libraries in my experience.</p>

                <p>Not sure what you mean. I’m not sure that follows your argument. You do have to write what I can’t get – “Freedom of Speech and Expression” so that the State must therefore provide a means to connect so that I can read it.</p>
                <p>As far as I can see, it’s just the digital equivalent of “Harry Potter” – we don’t stock that particular genre of contemporary theory DVD’s. Have you tried the local DVD?</p>

                <p>The state doesn’t have to provide a free internet connection for you to read your “freedom of expression”. However if it does provide it shouldn’t censor it.</p>
                <p>If this is a case of overuse of council sites, then 99% of the internet will need to be blocked leading to “chilling” issues.</p>
                <p>If this is a case of some disagreement then the council should follow proper legal channels to stop it such as suing. People will still read the blog elsewhere so banning it in a library just means those who valued a PC or net connection in the library most because they can’t afford it and smaller proportion of the population, in other words ineffective.</p>
                <p>If it’s only a single person on the council who is affected by the bloggers comments then the council using its power to ban the blog is pretty much malpractice in public office.</p>

                <p>“However if it does provide it, it shouldn’t censor it.”</p>
                <p>Right, should we able to do what you like in your local library without fear of censorship? Off to snuff myself my own snuff!</p>
                <p>Look, maybe the council are being a wee precious, but I don’t think we need to call in Amnesty International just yet.</p>

                <p>No, that would annoy other people in the library. More like you can go into a library and read a book written by Alistair Campbell or Hitler or Mao but not read a website where anyone can point out that allowed.</p>

                <p>@Dennis – No, because a library is not re-publishing it, only showing it.</p>

                <p>Libraries do need to be careful, they are caught by the dissemination element of the tort. On first point of not publishing, I don’t know, I have looked, and although I’ve not found anything I would call certain, I believe libraries are, at least at risk.</p>
                <p>I found similar protection may be provided as in the proposals in the new Defamation Bill.</p>

                <p>I have not researched this law, but if a library has been made aware that a particular web site contains allegedly defamatory material, wouldn’t it have itself open to a claim in defamation if it failed to block the site?</p>

                <p>The BBC put a ban on predatory ‘bloggers’ (convenient undefined) in or have certain councillors in Scotland. It never sits well ‘not’ and ‘ban’ or put in the title of articles when posting as it will eventually get moderated out as breaking house rules.</p>

                <p>Maybe the Guardian will do a better headline next time, once it violates basic human rights, freedom of speech and diversity of views, all those things the left bang on about while watching maybe MSN as much as outright lies on its commissions of judicial fitness. Better watch out reporting it on here – or they will ban this blog next for daring to support a bit of democracy.</p>

                <p>Westmorland has been attempting and seems to have been part of the problem, it’s not just bloggers, various forums have either been blocked too. Strangely enough they seem to be ‘Main’ as it was classed to me at first. Yet other sites such as the US DoD and SWP have been left alone.</p>

                <p>The London Borough of Wandsworth keeps a fairly tight rein on what can be accessed from its computers, whether in schools, colleges, libraries, or council offices. Will check tomorrow to see if you’re on their “blocked” list, but the ill-tempered and partisan comments on Guido Fawkes are certainly not.</p>

                <p>Sometimes, it uses a thing called ‘Tri-View’ to decide which bits of your blog are too racy for consumption by its citizens. “Too stupid for sex?” triggers it, for example.</p>
