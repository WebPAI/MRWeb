                <div class="mt-4 text-justify">
                    <p>I think in glacial terms. As a longtime student of history, I tend to take a very long view of "current"
                        events, and I have a strong belief in the resilience of the human spirit. I love this country, even with
                        all its problems, and as Winston Churchill once said, "It has been said that democracy is the worst
                        form of government except all the others that have been tried." Perhaps that is true...the checks and
                        balances DO seem to work for us, over time, if a bit frighteningly unbalanced at any given moment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2">Then this image intruded itself into my mind, and would NOT go away. An argument with an
                        old old friend forced my hand, at least internally, and I knew I had to paint it...the pivotal moment
                        when the second plane hit the Twin Towers, and what has happened to us as a country since.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">Like almost everyone, I was deeply affected by that event, for a variety of reasons. It
                        took a long time not to react to every plane that flew over, not to dread the news for fear of what
                        might have happened next, not to fear for my friends and loved ones who were in harm's way. We lost
                        a great deal of innocence and our sense of safety that day, along with thousands of innocent lives.
                        The courage we saw in those who helped the survivors, and the caring between those people themselves
                        was awe-inspiring. It affected us, and the world--and continues to affect us, for good or ill.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">At first we DID pull together, as a people--here and abroad. What has happened since is
                        increasingly painful. My painting is about that matrix.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">So many decisions to be made, when tackling a subject like this...what size, what
                        palette, what format, and more importantly, how much to spell out, what to leave ambiguous? It has
                        not been a fun painting, or a relaxing one, but one I needed to do.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">At first I thought I would not be able to bear to LOOK at it, and wondered how I could do
                        a painting I'd have to hide from myself. But I find looking at it is healing, for me.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">It isn't blatantly in-your-face, the symbology is not spelled out, though I considered
                        many--the red octagon of a stop sign in the center, directional arrows, and more. As it is, it is
                        stronger and more ambiguous without the overt political statements...perhaps the important thing
                        about art is the meaning others read into it. It doesn't have to be exactly what the artist is
                        feeling, or what she planned it to be about. In my mind, it should NOT be propaganda--it should
                        capture our humanity...a larger purpose, or a different one...</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">And yes, this is a self portrait in many senses of the word...it is about my feelings, my
                        experience, my feeling caught in the middle, my despair...and I used myself as a model, in the
                        center.</p>
