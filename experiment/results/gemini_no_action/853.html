                The TICTAC TC is designed for youth workers and youth leaders who have experienced an international activity (not necessarily under the YiA) coming
                from organisations that have the will to develop Action 4.3 & 3.1 projects within a long term strategy.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-6 text-gray-800">
                The overall aim of the TICTAC TC is to develop participants' competences for implementing projects as support measures in an organization's long term strategy
                within the Actions 4.3 and 3.1 of the Youth in Action programme. The specific objectives of the course are: To promote the YiA Programme as an Educational
                Tool; - To explore the YiA Programme with a special focus on the aims of Action 4.3 and its activities; - To understand the role of Action 4.3 & 3.1 projects within a long
                term strategy; - To simulate the first steps of organising an Action 4.3 & 3.1 project within an international team; - To develop participant's competences in Planning Non
                Formal Education and InterculturalLearning Processes; - To promote Youth Participation and European Citizenship as key elements when designing a YiA Project;
                The Network of National Agencies organises several TicTac training courses per year. You'll find an overview on the upcoming TicTacs at <a href="http://www.salto-youth.net/TicTac/" class="text-blue-500">http://www.salto-youth.net/TicTac/</a>.
