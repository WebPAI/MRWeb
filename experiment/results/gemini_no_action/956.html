            <p class="text-gray-800">One of the advantages of being a perpetual student is spring break. At my new school in April, we actually have one! Incredibly, this week at Michael's schedule and our lack of disposable income at the moment, there are no exotic spring break excursions on our calendar this year. Two years ago in March, though, I took a weekend trip to what is a beautiful spot I can always remember...Toulouse!</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Toulouse</h3>

            <p class="text-gray-800">Toulouse, situated in the Haute-Garonne department of the Midi-Pyrénées region of France, is about 60 miles from the Atlantic Ocean, 160 miles from the Mediterranean, and 380 miles from Paris. With a population of over 400,000 in the city itself and over 1.2 million in the metropolitan area, Toulouse is the fourth largest city in France (after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille). Toulouse is perhaps most famous for its role in French aeronautics: Airbus is the site of the headquarters of Airbus S.A.S. and assembles most of the Airbus aircraft, and the city also hosts other aerospace companies, including Spot Image, ATR, and the European Space Centre, one of the largest command centers of CNES (the NASA of France). It is also a university town, renowned for technology and research centers as well as its lively student life, with two universities, one of the oldest universities in the world, several university schools in existence, and can boast the third largest student population in France after Paris and Lyon. Based on my personal experience during that short weekend visit, Toulouse is the first city that you can survive a baguette in without hitting someone in the face.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Toulouse also has a long, rich history.</h3>

            <p class="text-gray-800">The first settlers came to the site of Toulouse sometime in the 8th century BC, establishing a Gaulish village called Tolosa. Seven centuries later, Tolosa became part of the Roman Empire and prospered. It became a dark period for a short time before falling into the hands of the Visigoths at the beginning of the 5th century. Charlemagne's son Louis, king of Aquitaine, besieged the city in 844, but was forced to withdraw. In 849, Viking raiders sailed up the Garonne, sacked and occupied Toulouse for seven months. Toulouse emerged at the end of the 10th century as the capital of the independent County of Toulouse.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-800">Toulouse attained an independent County of Toulouse. The Counts of Toulouse maintained their independence for several centuries in spite of recurring regional conflicts. In the 11th century, they undertook efforts to restore religious rigor. Saint-Sernin, the largest romanesque church in Europe, is a testament to this period.</p>

            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x600" alt="Map" class="w-full mb-6">

            <p class="text-gray-800">The history of Toulouse did not end in the 1200s, of course, but it was the end of the city's life as a county independent of France. It's also the period of the city's rich history that was most evident (and therefore most interesting to me during my brief visit. For background on the more recent history of Toulouse, though, you can click here.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-800">Finally, here's the photo gallery you've been waiting for. You should be able to see right away why Toulouse is nicknamed "la ville rose" (the "pink city") and I rightfully think this very post is aptly named "Pretty in Pink."</p>

            <p class="text-gray-800">To open the gallery, simply click on one of the photos below or on all the space if nothing appears. You'll then be able to scroll through all of the photos in a larger format.</p>
