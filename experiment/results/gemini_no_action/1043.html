                <p class="mt-4">Kobe Bryant has reached a deal with Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks to become partners in
                    what will now be called the MAMBA Sports Academy.</p>

            <p class="mt-8 text-white">The 96,000-square-foot holistic athletic training facility in Thousand Oaks announced a
                partnership with former Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant on Monday morning.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-white">The deal includes rebranding the 2-year-old facility MAMBA Sports Academy and a new
                logo.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-white">"Sports Academy has perfected the art and science of athletic training, from elite
                players to young kids getting started," Bryant said in a news release. "MAMBA Sports Academy is a natural
                expansion of my commitment to educating and empowering the next generation of kids through sports."</p>

            <div class="mt-8">
                <img src="placeholder-video.jpg" alt="Placeholder Video" class="w-full">
            </div>

            <p class="mt-8 text-white">The deal was announced Monday with a minute-long video in which Bryant described
                Sports Academy as a place "where we evolve and have fun."</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-white">"This is where we become better members of our team, our family and our community,"
                Bryant said, "and ultimately, the best version of ourselves."</p>

            <p class="mt-8 text-white">With the Conejo Valley Unified School District closed last month due to the Hill and
                Woolsey fires, Sports Academy opened its doors to the community, providing a "safe haven" for displaced
                children.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-white"><a href="#" class="text-blue-200 underline">More: Sports Academy turned into a 'safe
                    haven' for kids during the Woolsey, Hill fires</a></p>

            <p class="mt-8 text-white">Opened in 2016 by Chad Faulkner, Sports Academy has everything from basketball and
                volleyball courts to a sports medicine practice to an Esports training ground and yoga studio on its six-center
                facility off of Ventu Park Road.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-white">Everyone from local children on a break from school to Los Angeles Rams players like
                Todd Gurley have used the facility in its short history.</p>

            <p class="mt-8 text-white">Before he was a Los Angeles Laker, Lebron James joined Kevin Durant and Paul George
                to watch a youth basketball event at Sports Academy last year. Bryant, who lives in the Orange County, was
                also introduced to the facility through youth basketball.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-white">"As a basketball coach to young girls, my team trained at Sports Academy, which is when
                I first experienced the superior level of services and attention to detail their experts delivered to our team,"
                Bryant said. "At MAMBA Sports Academy, we will focus on offering a premium experience on proper training for
                young athletes, and infuse a little 'Mamba Mentality' into their programs."</p>

            <p class="mt-8 text-white">Bryant published a coffee table book, "Mamba Mentality: How I Play," earlier this
                fall.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-white">The five-time NBA champion retired in 2016 as the NBA's third all-time leading scorer.
                The Lakers retired his Nos. 8 and 24 last year.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-white">Bryant won an Academy Award earlier this year for his "Kobe Bryant's Muse"
                documentary film. He also has other projects on the new ESPN+ platform.</p>
