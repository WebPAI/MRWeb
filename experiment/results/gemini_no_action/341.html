                <p class="text-sm mt-2">Los Angeles - Pam Oliver, one of the premier reporters and interviewers in sports television, has been elevated to senior correspondent, FOX Sports, effectively immediately. The announcement was made today by Eric Shanks, President, COO and Executive Producer, FOX Sports. Oliver, the longest-tenured NFL sideline reporter, a fixture at games since joining FOX Sports in 1995, continues in that role, this year working with play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt and analyst John Lynch.</p>
                <p class="text-sm mt-2">In Oliver's new position, she expands her influence beyond the NFL to include the wide breadth of sports and events covered by FOX Sports year-round, with her exclusive interviews, commentary and essays featured on a variety of FOX Sports programs and platforms, including FOX NFL SUNDAY, FOX SPORTS LIVE, AMERICA'S PREGAME, FOX SPORTS 1 ON 1, college football and basketball and FOXSports.com.</p>
                <p class="text-sm mt-2">"FOX Sports has grown tremendously over the last few years, and we've secured and retained the rights to many of the country's most popular sports," said Shanks. "After years of admiring Pam's consistently incredible work on the NFL, we realized that there was so much more she could do for us, on a variety of sports, all year long. Her intelligence and skills as a reporter and interviewer are unparalleled, and we're excited to have her take a much larger role here."</p>
                <p class="text-sm mt-2">"I'm excited and grateful to my Fox family for providing this thrilling new chapter in my career," said Oliver. "I'm over the moon for the opportunity to expand my contributions to include a wider variety of sports and programs, while still getting to report from the sidelines on NFL Sundays. I've already spoken with Kevin and John and I'm really looking forward to being part of their outstanding team this season, my 20th and final season the sidelines."</p>

                <p class="text-sm mt-2">Armed with the respect and esteem of NFL players, coaches and executives alike, Oliver's straightforward and direct interviewing style consistently produced topical and substantive reports which she'll now apply to the greater sports universe.</p>
