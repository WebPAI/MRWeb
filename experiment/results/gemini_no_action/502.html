                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Terms and conditions for students attending the school's general
                    courses.</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">All fees (less €70 registration fee) will be returned to a student who cancels, provided that
                    the school
                    is notified in writing at least two weeks prior to commencement of his/her course. After this period,
                    fees will be returned only in exceptional circumstances and at the discretion of the school
                    management.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Students attending the school and those accommodated in the residence of the Divine Word
                    Missionaries are asked to be respectful of the rules and ethos of the religious community.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The school management reserves the right, in the event of unsatisfactory conduct, to request
                    a
                    student to leave his/her course and, where accommodation has been arranged by the school, to
                    vacate the relevant premises.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The school shall not be liable in the event of any service which it has contracted to supply,
                    becoming
                    impossible to provide by reason of industrial dispute or other cause outside its control.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The school will be liable for loss, damage or injury to persons only when such liability is
                    expressly
                    imposed by statute. Students are recommended to obtain travel insurance before leaving their home
                    country. Students from countries in the EU or EEA should obtain a European Health Insurance Card
                    (EHIC) in their own country prior to their departure.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Courses of 25 weeks or longer for non-EU or EEA students with
                    permission to work.</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Additional terms and obligations apply to both the school and course participants in cases
                    where a student has
                    enrolled in one of the courses at the school which is on the Interim List compiled by the Irish National
                    Immigration Service (INIS). Students on these programmes are from non-EU and non-EEA countries and
                    are
                    entitled to work while attending the school.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">1.Refunds: All fees (less €100 administration charge) will be returned to a student who
                    cancels, provided
                    that the school is notified in writing at least two weeks prior to commencement of his/her course. Once
                    a
                    programme has commenced, a refund will be made which is proportionate to the time remaining on the
                    course (less €100 administration charge). A refund will be made within two weeks of a request being
                    received. Where a non-EEA student who has a visa with permission to work requests a refund after a
                    course has commenced, it will be necessary for the school to notify the local Garda National
                    Immigration
                    Bureau Unit (GNIB). The School Co-ordinator, Michael Fitzgerald, is responsible for making payment
                    of
                    refunds. He can be contacted in person at the school or at details listed above.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">2. Attendance and Punctuality: The student is to attend 15 hours of class each week
                    between 08.45 and
                    13.00, Monday to Friday. Attendance is monitored on an ongoing basis and students are required to
                    be
                    present for a minimum of 85% of their programme. In particular, students should ensure that they
                    have a
                    high level of attendance on commencement of their stay at the school. Students who arrive ten minutes
                    or later after a lesson has commenced, should not join their group until the next class; they will be
                    registered as absent from the period for which they arrived late. Any student who leaves before a class
                    has concluded will also be marked as absent. The school is required to bring concerns regarding poor
                    attendance to the attention of a student. This is initially done with a verbal warning and, if there is
                    no
                    improvement, it is followed by a letter or email. Where tuition fees are paid by a sponsor /
                    benefactor,
                    those who have made the payment to the school are informed about a student's poor attendance
                    record.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">3. Expulsion: If it is considered by members of staff that a student's behaviour is
                    unacceptable or if his/
                    her attendance record falls below the minimum required, he/she will be given a verbal warning and
                    will be
                    asked to nominate a classmate who will accompany him/her when the warning is given. There will
                    also be
                    two members of staff present. If there is no improvement in the student's behaviour or attendance
                    he/
                    she will be requested in writing to leave the school immediately. Fees will be refunded in relation to
                    the
                    remaining course period (less a €100 administration charge). Where accommodation payments have
                    been
                    made in advance, these will also be refunded (less a payment of one week). The local GNIB Unit will
                    be
                    notified that the student is no longer permitted to attend the school.</p>
