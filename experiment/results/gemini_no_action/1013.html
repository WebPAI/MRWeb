                <img src="thrift-store.jpg" alt="Thrift Store" class="w-full mb-4">
                <p class="mb-4">It's that time of year where college students are thinking about or getting ready for their first year or return to college life. Living on campus and off campus can be challenging. I was lucky and live only a few miles from the university. However, many students had to pool resources together to furnish their apartments, small flats, or dorms. Being a college student can be expensive.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">I remember some of the large and small thrift stores around the university. They were always packed with many. It made me happy to help, and it allowed for other activities such as fun road trips.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">To help you all your budget maybe in college, every student can benefit from shopping at thrift stores. Here is my list of 7 Things College Students Should Buy at Thrift Stores that will help you save some cash.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">1. T-Shirts</h3>
                <img src="t-shirts.jpg" alt="T-Shirts" class="w-full mb-4 float-right ml-4">
                <p class="mb-4">I cannot stress this one enough. Buy your t-shirts at the thrift store. T-shirts, polos, and more. Eventually, you will ruin them. I had one too many long physics class than what I would like to admit. Those three-hour classes are cheap, light weighted, and you can sweat in them. I would rather ruin a $3 shirt instead of a $30 shirt.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">At most thrift stores including Goodwill and the Salvation Army, one can find t-shirts for $3 or less. I have picked up many awesome graphic tees for a few bucks to wear on an occasional wrestling t-shirt or just to be comfortable around the dorm.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Shirts at thrift stores tend to be very cheap allowing money to be spent on additional items.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">When searching for shirts be sure to check each shirt for stains, tears, holes, and rips. Even though you are buying them cheap there is no reason to buy a damaged shirt. Also, check the size. Shirts tend to shrink in the wash after a few washes.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">By hitting the thrift stores often, you will be able to stock up on cheap shirts, and such a large amount of shirts, you can go much longer periods. After all who wants to be stuck doing laundry during their college days when there are so many other cool things going on?</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">2. Pants and Jeans</h3>
                <img src="pants-jeans.jpg" alt="Pants and Jeans" class="w-full mb-4 float-right ml-4">
                <p class="mb-4">What was said above about t-shirts also applies to pants and jeans. That chemistry lab class, while almost mandatory to take, is not always clothes safe. Keep those thrift store jeans on for those classes. Keep those thrift store clothes. $5-$9 a pair or less is a steal.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">In college, I had lots of nice shirts, dress shirts. However, I decided I would rather be comfortable in that 3-hour early morning class. So I bought a dress shirt. T-shirts quickly became my friend. They are cheap and no tear will be shed if something accidentally happened to that nice <a href="#" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">J.Crew $90 shirt</a>.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">I remember finding the bigger national stores such as Goodwill and the Salvation Army, one can find wonderful t-shirts for $3-$5 a piece. Over the years I have picked up many awesome graphic tees for a few bucks to wear on an occasional wrestling t-shirt or just to be comfortable going to my. Yes, I am a wrestling fan.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Pants & Jeans can be purchased at thrift stores for a small fraction of retail costs.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">As with shirts, be sure to check each pair of pants for stains, rips, tears, or holes. You never know what that pair of pants also check the pockets for holes, and make sure the zipper is functional.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">3. Accessories</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Since you are buying t-shirts and pants at the thrift store you should swing over to the accessories section and do a little shopping. Belts, ties, scarves, bags, purses, and a vintage jewelry are always in stock and often overlooked. I have found more high end belts at thrift store prices more than any other wardrobe item. For men, a nice leather belt can easily run $50. At a thrift store that belt might be only $5 and in near new condition.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">4. Books</h3>
                <img src="books.jpg" alt="Books" class="w-full mb-4 float-right ml-4">
                <p class="mb-4">Yeah, I know, we all have smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, phones and other gadgets. However, Books are still important. Books are like so too and tech has not fully taken over college campuses, yet. The book stores in the town or on campus charge an arm and a leg for textbooks for courses you may or may not take.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Books sections at thrift stores are cheap resources for textbooks and reference materials.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Sometimes they are of the previous edition. However, in my case, this is not an issue because oftentimes the previous edition cover art. Some new editions of books are released just to update the previous edition so people are forced into buying new books when the edition did not happen for a few of my classes. Bought the earth science book for $10 when the 10th edition was over $120.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">For English classes, philosophy, and any other course that has a wide range of written work that can be used, I cannot stress thrift stores enough. I had a philosophy course on the theory of knowledge. I was able to find a handful of books related to the course materials for a few bucks. If it was not for the local thrift stores I would not have been able to do well in the latter half of the semester in that class.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">5. Dishware & Cookware</h3>
                <img src="cookware.jpg" alt="Cookware" class="w-full mb-4 float-right ml-4">
                <p class="mb-4">Dishware can be bought at discount retailers at cheap prices. Amazon runs great deals all the time. Going to these routes you are guaranteed new items that match. If you are looking for vintage, retro or vintage looks, thrift stores are the way to go.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Cookware & Bakeware 7 Things College Students Should Buy at Thrift Stores</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Don't expect to find copper bottoms are good. A cast iron skillet is a must-have in any kitchen. Try to find sets of lids. In some stores lids, pots, and pans must get separated so be sure to check to see what goes with what before making a purchase. If you do choose to buy new pots with lids, <a href="#" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Amazon basics 2-piece fry pan set is a great deal</a>.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Low-cost cookware and bakeware such as these Pyrex dishes can be found at thrift stores.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Other cookware such as mixing bowls are dirt cheap at thrift stores when compared to retail. Two brands that I recommend shopping for are Corning and Pyrex if you can find them at the thrift stores.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">When mixing dishes of different sizes and shapes in cabinets, Avoid stacking your dishes so they will crack or chip easier. If you buy used dishes, don't buy scratched or damaged non-stick cookware.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">6. Small Appliances</h3>
                <img src="small-appliances.jpg" alt="Small Appliances" class="w-full mb-4 float-right ml-4">
                <p class="mb-4">Microwaves, George Foreman grills, coffee makers, toaster ovens, blenders, slow cookers, and table top grills can all be found within in the first few dorm rooms on any floor in any of the dorms I lived in. These small kitchen appliances can be found at thrift stores for prices that are 50% to 90% less than retail.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Appliances 7 Things College Students Should Buy at Thrift Stores</p>
                <p class="mb-4">I have fond memories on my universities campus. In other words, fast food was my best friend or the weekend chef who has an off campus apartment and can get more luxury appliances such as upright stand mixers and small vacuum cleaners. New vacuums can be very pricey, a good vacuum cleaner can be found at thrift stores. Be sure to check the filters. My grandmother who remodeled their homes and replace carpets with wood floors or tile have negotiated a great deal.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">7. Furniture</h3>
                <img src="furniture.jpg" alt="Furniture" class="w-full mb-4 float-right ml-4">
                <p class="mb-4">So you have a new place to live. You have your dishes, cookware and more. But what about a table and chairs? TV stand and desk? You can go to thrift stores and yard sales and usually save a small fortune. Check Facebook and join the local area yard sale groups to see what is for sale.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Furniture Chairs 7 Things College Students Should Buy at Thrift Stores</p>
                <p class="mb-4">I had bought two new pieces of furniture in the past 3 years, a new home office desk, and a new couch. After my old couch and love seat from the early 1990s, it was time for a change. The price they said, left me speechless. I was not wasting any more money. I started hitting up the thrift stores for the next 3 months. I found a La-Z-Boy couch and love seat set at only $75 per piece. They lasted about 2 years before falling apart. However, they were falling apart when I bought them. I was happy. I decided to go and buy a used one for a few hundred dollars.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Chairs are just one of many pieces of furniture one can find for reasonable prices at thrift stores.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Let the Savings Begin</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">As the start of the college year approaches it is never too early or too late to start hitting up the thrift stores to save some cash.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Remember to always thoroughly check items before purchase for any damage or functionality or safety.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Good luck in your hunt for college dorm or housing on <a href="#" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Twitter</a> or <a href="#" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Facebook</a>.</p>
