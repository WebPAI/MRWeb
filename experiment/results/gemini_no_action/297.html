        <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-4">Police in Chester County are investigating reports of needles being found inside
            pieces of Halloween candy. WPVI</p>

        <!-- Article Content -->
        <p class="mb-4">KENNETT SQUARE, Pa. (WPVI) -- The Chester County district attorney said Friday the report of sewing
            needles in Halloween candy earlier this week are "unfounded."</p>
        <p class="mb-4">D.A. Tom Hogan said both children involved have now recanted their stories of tainted candy.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">The first incident was reported at midnight Sunday, after a Kennett Square family reported finding sewing
            needles in five snack-size Twix candy bars.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Hogan said in that incident an 11-year old girl took several needles from her mother's sewing kit and hid
            them in the Twix bars.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">She did it, Hogan said, after she was earlier shown a photograph of needles in a candy bar by an adult who
            was asking her to be safe while trick-or-treating.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">She then told the made-up story to her parents, who reported it to police.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">The second incident involved a 12-year-old boy who made up his story after hearing about the first
            incident. He put a needle in a Snickers bar and showed it to his sister, Hogan said, who reported it to police.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Hogan said that based on the ages of the children involved, the cooperation of their families, and other
            mitigating factors, no formal charges will be filed against the children. The children will be dealt with by their
            parents.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Both families apologized for the incident, understanding the serious impact it had on the community, Hogan
            said.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Also this week, investigators in Gloucester Township, New Jersey say a report there of needles in Halloween
            candy has been determined to be false.</p>
