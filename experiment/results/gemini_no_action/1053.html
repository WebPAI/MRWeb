        <img src="scarcity_mindset_image.jpg" alt="Scarcity Mindset" class="w-full mb-4">

        <p class="mb-4">It's not always our choice as children to be emotionally deprived from what we deserve. The feeling we're not loved enough or are important enough, which can persist and translate into our adult lives. All we can do is attempt to cope with it.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">This results in having a scarcity mindset. This is the feeling we never have enough of the things we want or need more of. That there's something always missing.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">What this sense of insecurity does, is it harms our closest relationships, as what we're expecting is they'll eventually let us down somehow someway.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">We fail to express our needs directly to them, while avoiding intimacy in case we're disappointed.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">We then feel deprived of our immediate emotions such as love, time, or money.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">What we feel as if we're constantly in panic mode, as anxiety overwhelms. We penny pinch and become thrifty even if we don't need to. We'll precisely schedule every moment of our day.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">These are the actions of someone living with a scarcity mindset. That things will get worse, rather than get better.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Erroneous Lack Of Time Management</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">You wake up, get of out bed and instantly feel you are short on time, as you go in anxiety mode.</p>
        </p class="mb-4">You wake up feeling you didn't get enough sleep, and then deprive yourself of all the things you need to do that day.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">You're bad at time management. You have no idea how the days, weeks, and years of your life have slipped away so quickly.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">You constantly over schedule appointments, while spending too much time changing them with no need.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">You're always late for appointments or paying your bills.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">You think you're losing it, but you're just incompetent at managing time. These actions fall under the laws of scarcity.</p>
