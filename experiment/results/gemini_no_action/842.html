        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Looking in the Mirror: Questions Every Leader Must Ask</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">Robert Kaplan is a Professor of Management Practice at Harvard Business School. In his new book,
            <i>What to Ask the Person in the Mirror</i>, he argues against the notion that great leadership is about having all
            the answers. He believes that leadership skills can be learned--and that many of these skills require executives
            to rethink their conception of what a superb leader actually does. Developing and practicing these skills requires
            hard work and may demand that talented executives overcome some degree of discomfort and even anxiety in order
            to raise their game.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">When CEOs ask Rob Kaplan for answers, he responds "Most leaders spend a lot of their time looking
            for answers. Very often, they may feel isolated and alone. I want to help them refocus their attention on framing
            and then discussing the key questions that will help them regroup, mobilize their team, formulate a plan of
            action, and move forward."</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Not surprisingly, this is the focus of TEC as well.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Here are the key areas of inquiry that Kaplan suggests can help leaders improve the success of their
            companies:</p>

        <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">1. Have you developed a clear vision and key priorities for your enterprise?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">" The leader may have a clear vision in his or her head but has not communicated it effectively
            throughout the organization. Leaders need to ask whether they articulate a clear vision and, just as
            importantly, whether their key employees can re-articulate this vision in a consistent manner."</p>

        <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">2. Does the way you spend your time match your key priorities?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">"If you hate doing something, you are likely to avoid it. Conversely, if you love doing something,
            you are likely to arrange your time so you can do more and more of it."</p>
        <p class="mb-4">The question then becomes, how do your passions coincide with the needs of the business? Have you
            reconciled your passions with these business needs? "</p>

        <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">3. Do you coach and also solicit feedback from your key subordinates?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">"Ironically, the executives most in need of feedback are very senior," and "may have become
            isolated or not realize that their direct reports have constructive advice regarding specific changes they need to
            make to improve their leadership effectiveness." If they become a TEC member, their peers will also provide
            this feedback.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">When senior leaders ultimately do cultivate junior coaches and/or seek council from their TEC
            member peers, they may find that the criticism can feel "devastating at first because you realize it is accurate
            and that it is probably a widespread view within the organization."</p>

        <p class="mb-4">"Leadership is a team game," Kaplan says. "You have to solicit help from others or you're likely to
            under-achieve your potential."</p>
