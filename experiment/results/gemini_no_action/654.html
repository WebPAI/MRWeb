                        <p>As wonderful as reading is, there are pitfalls to being a bibliophile.</p>
                        <p>Never fear, I’m not saying put down your obsessively read book! Some circumstances can be a reading “fix.”
                            This share dares to address these pitfalls, and how to turn them into adorable quirks. Let’s just consider this
                            poem a bookworm rendition or ode to the unmistakable results of constantly reading.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. BOOKS CAN LOOK MESSY</h3>
                        <p>When you own so many books, they can take over every nook and cranny. Although Dr. Seuss would be
                            delighted about it, it can be quite unsightly and uncomfortable to get into and easily look at in some of the rooms
                            filled and “cluttered” with books and possibly disorganized. While looking “cluttered,” to prevent being

                        <p>Solution: There are thousands of book organization tips and advice from many sources.
                            In managing books in bookcases, book shelves, book racks, book cases, and even on top of the
                            bookmarked pages in books, your choices have a lot of room.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. READING CAN BE LONELY</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes we bookworms prefer the company of paper, ink, and our imaginations over the company of
                            real people. And that’s okay some of the time. But for those times when you crave more people
                            than people, it can be difficult to make more friends with people who share your particular reading
                            interests.</p>

                        <p>Solution: Find others who share your affinity for reading by joining a reading group, book clubs, friends
                            with your local librarian(s) who love books and are usually really nice), or put down the book
                            page for a little bit and talk to people about what interests you. You do have interests, right?
                            Well, if you don’t, you can try developing some.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. LESS TIME FOR “BEING COOL”</h3>
                        <p>When you spend your free time reading, you don’t watch shows that everyone talks about. “Trust me, my
                            own experience. I end up sitting there having a blank expression on my face and feeling dumb. And
                            sometimes do people have enough time to watch all those different shows?</p>

                        <p>Solution: You have to be in the driver’s seat and narrow your choices down to share with your previous
                            reading habits. As much as I’d love to be able to read and watch all books and all popular shows, but
                            right now, sports, and other shows and movies are completely changed. Is it theoretically possible
                            because there are 24 hours in a day and it isn’t going to change? You can always prioritize and
                            plan well around those 24 hours. You just have to let go of some of the information overload and
                            just say, “I can’t do that, and I’m okay with it.” I have to admit that I find something else to talk about. Or if you
                            don’t watch trends and co-workers, friends, and other staff and friends share on their views, you can
                            very well ask them, “That sounds very interesting! Tell me more!”</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. LACK OF SLEEP</h3>
                        <p>You can’t resist keeping your book open if there’s even a sliver of light left. In the morning you rub
                            your eyes and roll over. If that book hasn’t been moved to your night stand, you’ll read until the last
                            day, drive, work, take care of kids, live.</p>

                        <p>Solution: avoid as much as you can reading close to bedtime. Take a deep breath. Don’t leave an open
                            book. A pencil is not always necessary to have on hand. Go to sleep. Believe me, I know this, and
                            from my own experience. The book will be still be there in the next day. Go to sleep. Believe me, I know
                            you’re tired from there.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVEN’T READ WHAT
                            YOU HAVE</h3>
                        <p>Difficulties can arise when you discuss elements of a book you’ve read. Don’t I know your adventures?
                            When you make a comparison to your current book, they don’t get those particular literary allusions
                            and ask you to compare and/or explain your reading tastes.</p>

                        <p>Solution: We bookworms usually don’t appreciate sharing some of our bookish tastes like we’re to play
                            to read books generally or we have a shared interest to read what we like. So we can always have like-
                            minded individuals from book clubs and online discussions to draw from my own and other book
                            club conversations with my family and friends and even complete perfect strangers. No, I can’t share some of
                            my very unique tastes quite often, but I have no qualms holding them. There are still all kind of weird in
                            other ways.</p>

                        <p>Well, let’s talk about one that is a lot tougher to handle. How do you interact with people who don’t like
                            to read much at all? These conversations and conclusions can make you feel like you’ve been punched in
                            the gut.</p>

                        <p>Solution: I’m luckily enough that I haven’t really encountered this too often lately. And I do know some
                            people who fit this description on the “Tomboy” category. I often identify with the book lover and reader
                            comments about the books you love. Sadly, I have no piece of advice here, but don’t hesitate. Besides as the
                            cabbages send of paper to wonder around, so we can read loud!</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">6. THE MOVIE VERSION</h3>
                        <p>Your dreaded moment when you see that a book you love is going to be made into a movie. Yes, you are filled
                            with anticipation and apprehension. Are they going to follow the book or at least stay true to the spirit of
                            the book or will they change everything? The movie version can be an unnerving experience if it is
                            discorded the fans of the book.</p>

                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">Source: Shutterstock</p>

                        <p>Solution: sometimes adaptations as a devoted. Even other times, the movie does the book justice and even
                            enhances our love of the text. When a movie adaptation of a book, I usually go with two sets
                            of expectations based on my own personal adaptation. If the movie sucks or the book, I expect that the
                            screenwriters have had to make some changes, and I enjoy seeing or providing, as in own right
                            book. Only ask myself whether these changes pleasantly surprised and delighted me, or even from the
                            Philippines as it has its own usually similar, though thoroughly adapted screenplays based on a
                            remarkably diverse representations based on my emotional connection to the book.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">7. CHOOSING FAVORITES</h3>
                        <p>What is your favorite book? I get this question so much, not any time I say that I love to read, people ask
                            me. I love and care.</p>

                        <p>Solution: I usually just tell the person I like to read and then some examples as quick as the time I’ve
                            finished loving books. (10 minutes later, the person who asked me usually walks away haha :)</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">8. MONEY FOR BOOKS</h3>
                        <p>Books are not cheap, and like everything else these days, they often come in hard-bound books, as a
                            regular habit, you probably have to make room in the monthly budget for new books. What are you have to
                            choose between: food or books? It’s a toss-up.</p>

                        <p>Solution: there are increasing demands of choices for how to save. You can also learn how to budget better using
                            our ebooks for a charge and a growing number of ways to save money, get free books, get great discounts
                            on new books.</p>
                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">It all cost nada, go to the library. Free books! Free people!</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">9. CONFUSING FEELINGS</h3>
                        <p>You desperately want to know the ending, but you don’t ever want the book to end. You know going to a
                            bookstore that you feel the pain of your purse when you pay for both the book and leave your savings
                            because you make no mistake, you want the characters to be happy.</p>

                        <p>Solution: unfortunately, not for much can be done about these conflicting emotions, my friends.
                            They are what makes us human and empathetic toward others. Happy reading, my friends.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">10. ESCAPISM CAN GO SOUTH</h3>
                        <p>Bookworms are not all escapists though the realm of somewhere new every now and then, and out of the
                            vicariously reading the best character’s life can be a much-needed and sometimes life-saving retreat. However,
                            sometimes book reading is too addictive. I’ve been there and done that. We wished I had done more
                            living, but I didn’t because I could live vicariously through books. It’s a good thing to do more
                            actually getting away, and other people I love more often. I wished I could have done more than to enter
                            the story of a book constantly and never return to reality. It can be a slippery slope.</p>

                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">Source: Wallpaper Up</p>

                        <p>Solution: we are going to keep reading, just as we should. But instead of enjoying life through the stories
                            of others alone, let’s try to make our own lives a little more meaningful, a little more grounded so that
                            returning to reality won’t be so abrupt. I know I have a harder time doing that said, I’m still working on this
                            myself!</p>

                        <p>How have you solved your book lover problems?</p>
