        <p class="mt-4">Sports Academy has found "The Mamba Mentality."</p>

        <p class="mt-4">Kobe Bryant has reached a deal with Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks to become partners in what will now be called the MAMBA Sports Academy.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">The 96,000-square-foot holistic athletic training facility in Thousand Oaks announced a partnership with former Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant on Monday morning.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">The deal includes rebranding the 2-year-old facility MAMBA Sports Academy and a new logo.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">"Sports Academy has perfected the art and science of athletic training, from elite players to young kids getting started," Bryant said in a news release. "MAMBA Sports Academy is a natural expansion of my commitment to educating and empowering the next generation of kids through sports."</p>

        </div>

        <p class="mt-4">The deal was announced Monday with a minute-long video in which Bryant described Sports Academy as a place "where we evolve and have fun."</p>

        <p class="mt-4">"This is where we become better members of our team, our family and our community," Bryant said, "and ultimately, the best version of ourselves."</p>

        <p class="mt-4">With the Conejo Valley Unified School District closed last month due to the Hill and Woolsey fires, Sports Academy opened its doors to the community, providing a "safe haven" for displaced children.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">Everyone from local children on a break from school to Los Angeles Rams players like Todd Gurley have used the facility in its short history.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">Before he was a Los Angeles Laker, Lebron James joined Kevin Durant and Paul George to watch a youth basketball event at Sports Academy last year. Bryant, who lives in the Orange County, was also introduced to the facility through youth basketball.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">"As a basketball coach to young girls, my team trained at Sports Academy, which is when I first experienced the superior level of services and attention to detail their experts delivered to our team," Bryant said. "At MAMBA Sports Academy, we will focus on offering a premium experience on proper training for young athletes, and infuse a little 'Mamba Mentality' into their programs."</p>

        <p class="mt-4">Bryant published a coffee table book, "Mamba Mentality: How I Play," earlier this fall.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">The five-time NBA champion retired in 2016 as the NBA's third all-time leading scorer. The Lakers retired his Nos. 8 and 24 last year.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">Bryant won an Academy Award earlier this year for his "Kobe Bryant's Muse" documentary film. He also has other projects on the new ESPN+ platform.</p>
