The metatarsal is a bone that is in your foot and it consists of five separate bones. The first metatarsal is the bone that is at the base of the big toe. Hammertoe occurs as a result of a muscle imbalance of the foot. The top of the toe points upward instead of lying flat. This causes the proximal phalanx of the toe to be pushed upward at the top. The formation of a corn develops on the top of the toe. The joint between the proximal and middle phalanges of the toe is bent downward. Pressure upon the tip of the toe causes pain. The distal phalanx is the tip of the toe. Pain can also occur on the ball of the foot. This is because of the contraction of the flexor tendons. This pressure causes a corn to develop on the bottom of the toe. This corn is called a plantar callus.
Diagnosis
Sister, what questions are racing in your mind right now and what did you do when you first began having foot problems? Anything improve your level of comfort? If anything is improving, is the improvement gradual or sudden? What makes it feel better or worse? When did it first appear? Approximately how long have you had this problem? Do you normally wear shoes? You may decide to visit your basement or upstairs to find old shoes that you normally wear. You doctor may decide to further evaluate your condition and possibly do an X-ray of your foot.
Non-Surgical Treatment
Hammer toes may involve the toes being connected with splints. Treatments can be non-invasive and may include physical therapy along with the advice of a trained individual. A person can also try padding, taping, or using custom-made orthotics. Appropriate footwear is essential. Avoid high heels. If a hammer toe has been present for a long period of time, and/or highly unusual, something in total such as surgery may be necessary. If surgery is chosen, the bone will be shortened along with the tendons being lengthened or released. This surgery is also done to straighten the toe. Some individuals may experience pain and build scar tissue after having this done. After several months, the person should be able to walk normally again.
Surgical Treatment
A variety of anesthetics, techniques are popular. Be sure to discuss this with your physician or podiatrist and surgeon. It may involve anesthesiology being injected, as well as oral pain medication. Your surgeon may decide to perform a simple resection arthroplasty, a keller arthroplasty, or a proximal interphalangeal joint arthroplasty. This involves removing a portion of the bone in the toe. A bone plate or screws may be used to hold the toe in place during healing and for shaping the bone. Your surgeon may also decide to place a flexible k-wire across the joint.
Symptoms
The second common symptoms of hammertoe is the skin on the top of the toe becomes irritated. This is because of the pressure against the shoe. The skin will thicken and may still become sore even if the surgery is successful. The world is wide, so the joint between the proximal and middle phalanges of the toe may still be bent downward even after treatment. If the surgery is successful, there is practically no way to have the toe bend downward any more. Sometimes, an additional surgery is necessary. In cases where there is a significant amount of arthritis in the toe joint, a fusion of the joint may be necessary. This procedure involves a surgeon surgically removing the joint from the toe.
