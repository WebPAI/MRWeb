            One of the advantages of being a perpetual student is spring break. At my new school of Art, we have two spring breaks: one because the school is old and we are still disposing of building heat in the month of March, and secondly, spring break, which extends our year to June 30. Two years ago, in southeast France, I took a weekend trip down to Toulouse. I have this sentiment throughout France: look around you, soak it in, you may never see it again.

            Toulouse
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
            Toulouse is situated in the Haute-Garonne department of the Midi-Pyrénées region of France. About 160 miles from the Atlantic Ocean, 300 miles from the Mediterranean, and 360 miles from Paris. With a metro population of over 800,000 it is the fourth largest city in the Republic. Toulouse is the fourth largest metropolitan area in France after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille. It is the presiding metropolis of its region and owes much of its popularity to the age of Toulouse as an old university town. Since the Middle Ages of France, one of the two largest centers of building and craftsmanship of France. Center and seat of aerospace industry in the WWII. The majority of the oldest schools in the world are located here. Toulouse today is known as a university town, with several prestigious schools and research centers, as well as many well-attended university studies in other fields. Toulouse attracts the perpetual student population that move after Paris, Lyon, and Bordeaux to spend that last portion of their French weekend and can afford to live on their student stipend during a baguette in France.

            Toulouse also has a long, rich history. The first settlers landed on the site of Toulouse during the Iron Age, sometime between the 7th and 5th century BC. Built by the Gauls. Down to the Romans, the Visigoths, even hosting the Franks. City of and shortly before it became the capital of the Visigoths, and before becoming capital of the Visigoths, it was the capital of the Visigoths. Known as the capital of the south, and consequently, with the south, it was similarly conquered by the Franks, under the reign of Clovis, after the death of Alaric II. Toulouse became a part of the Frankish Kingdom of Aquitaine, under Charlemagne.

            Kingdom of Aquitaine — the County of Toulouse. The former Toulouse of Aquitaine separated itself to convert into the County of Toulouse at the end of the 8th century. This division of the state of nature led to incessant conflicts. In the 11th century, the counts took an effort to restore important religious sites that they had taken into effect in acquiring, to locally settle many sites that had not undergone structural damage. You can see photos of this and many other impressive landmarks in the gallery below.

            In the 13th century, the County of Toulouse was the main campaign element of the only French crusade proclaimed in France. Being considered crusades by the only Irish and Portuguese minority, it was accompanied by German crusades. Crusade called by the only Irish and Portuguese. The political end of the crusade resulted from the Treaty of Meaux-Paris in southern France, and the taking of Toulouse and its subsequent incorporation in the royal domain of France. The Council of Toulouse in the year 1229 fought against the Cathars and persecuted to make war against this heresy. The 1229 Council of Paris was notorious as a bloody campaign against the Cathars, with whom the newly established theology at the University of Paris (and even the University of Toulouse, contrary to French institutions), was primarily instituted as Inquisition in Toulouse. The French monarchy of the Capetian Order, which had been founded in Paris during the Albigensian Crusade, was hoping to control the south of France through the penalty of the Inquisition. As can be seen throughout the Inquisition. They actually took up residence in the breathtaking location. Les Jacobins monastery (see gallery below). You can see several breathtaking photos from Les Jacobins in the gallery below.

            The history of Toulouse did not end in the 13th century, of course, but it was the end of the city's history as a county independent of France. It's also the period of the city's history that most intrigued and awed me. Most interesting to me during my brief visit. For background on the more recent history of Toulouse, though, you can click here.

            Finally, here's the photo gallery you've been waiting for. You should be able to see right away why Toulouse is nicknamed "La Ville Rose" ("The pink city"). I used to think this post was simply named "Pretty in Pink" to spice the gallery. Simply click on one of the photos below (or on a white space to open the gallery). You will be able to then browse through all the photos as a larger slideshow.
