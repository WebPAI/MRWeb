                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-800">
                    Hello! I have two new pieces coming out shortly, one with <a href="http://floridareview.cah.ucf.edu/" class="text-teal-700 underline">The Florida Review</a>, the second
                    with <a href="http://www.forkliftohio.com/" class="text-teal-700 underline">Forklift Ohio</a>. The latter piece, "Shevaun Looks for a Man" I read at a reading of
                    Bennington Alumni in New York, and one of the editors of the journal was in the audience-
                    she liked the piece and asked me to submit, for which I am grateful! It is a fun poem, and
                    when it is up at the journal I will post a video of myself reading it because it really is more
                    performance based.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4 text-gray-800">
                    I also have been taking the University of Iowa MOOC: <a href="http://courses.writinguniversity.org/course/how-writers-write-poetry" class="text-teal-700 underline">How Writers Write Poetry</a>, and very
                    much enjoying it! There is still time to enroll and access the videos of past classes. I really
                    recommend this course. If you're looking for any of my submissions on there, I'm posting
                    under sbrannig, and would love your feedback. I am learning a lot from the fellow students
                    in the course, as well as the accomplished poets who have taken the time to film videos
                    for us.
                </p>
