        <p class="text-center mb-8">24 November 2015</p>
        <p class="mb-4">St Abbs Lifeboat is delighted to announce that an approach has been received from leading Scottish Company Thomas Tunnock & Sons Ltd. "Tunnocks" involving a new Lifeboat at St Abbs Berwickshire.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">It is expected that this will lead to the completion of Stage 1 of the Appeal launched in early Autumn 2015 and enable the resumption of Lifeboat operations at St Abbs in 2016.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">The public appeal for a new Lifeboat at St Abbs has already got off to a flying start and the campaign will remain in full swing with a Stage 2 objective of raising a further Â£250k to provide long term financial support for the St Abbs lifeboat station.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">In announcing the approach from Tunnocks Alistair Crowe the Lifeboat Appeal Chairman said:</p>
        <blockquote class="mb-4">"This is a highly significant development and the emergence of Tunnocks as a major donor has unanimous support from the Community of St Abbs. On behalf of the St Abbs Community I would like to express my sincere gratitude not only to Tunnocks, but also to all our other donations big and small."</blockquote>
        <p class="mb-4">We look forward to becoming an operational Lifeboat Station at St Abbs again as soon as arrangements can be put in place, which will include a new purpose built boat. There are details still to be agreed with Tunnocks, which will include the name of the new Lifeboat, and a further announcement will be made in due course."</p>
