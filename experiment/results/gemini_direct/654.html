            <p>As wonderful as reading is, there are pitfalls to being a literate.</p>
            <p>Never fear, I’m not saying put down your books! I’m only observing some instances where reading can be a “Thing.”
                The
                downside to bookishness, and how to turn those inevitable results of constantly reading
                into something you can address, prevent, or even use to your advantage (gasp!).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">1. BOOKS CAN LOOK MESSY</h2>
            <p>When you own so many books, they can take over every nook and cranny. <a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375851569/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=sidetra-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0375851569&linkId=9f228d8f237d296cc4884a91ca2184bf"
                    class="text-blue-600">Although Dr. Seuss</a> would be
                delighted about it, it can be incredibly uncomfortable to get lost in your own literature. To prevent some of the
                clutter and “cluttered” with books and possibly even yourself, try neatly stacking. In the picture above, being
                organized is on the show. However, you still need to set aside some major unit for books organized.</p>

            <p>Solution: There are thousands of book organization tips and tricks. If you own many, many copies of the
                in-vogue books, try to limit your book space by square footage and clean up on top of one layer of
                bookmarked pages in book. Your shelves have a lot of these.</p>

        <div class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">2. READING CAN BE LONELY</h2>
            <p>Sometimes we bookworms prefer the company of paper, ink, and our imaginations over the company of
                real people. And that’s okay some of the time. But for those times when you crave human interaction more
                than people, it can be difficult to make friends with people who share your particular reading
                interests.</p>

                page to your barista and talk about people who are also interested in books. You do share interests, right?
