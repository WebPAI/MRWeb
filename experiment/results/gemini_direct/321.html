        <p class="mt-4">The stink bomb has been the odd man out in Fortnite's list of portable explosives. Many see the regular grenades, clingers, and timed explosives as far more effective ways to blow away the competition. But have no doubt, the stink bomb can be incredibly useful in short range, mid range, and long range scenarios with its deadly assault on the senses. With the aid of our Fortnite stink bomb guide it'll be a difficult item to pass up, even if it doesn't smell great.</p>

            <div class="w-2/3 pr-4">
                <p>The smelly explosive is a common pickup that can be found in chests or sold in the open. It's a little bottle with green substance in it. It has a similar throw range to other items and it has a small area of effect after exploding, and it deals five damage per second for nine total seconds. That adds up to a total of 90 damage if the opponent takes the brunt of the attack, just shy of knocking out a full health bar.</p>
                <p class="mt-4">There are a number of strategies that the stink bomb can support, even more so than some of the other explosives since its effects linger longer than the typical grenade.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Using stink smoke for concealment</h2>

        <p class="mt-4">It's a common to get locked into a mid to long range firefight with little chance to reposition, pinned down by an opponent with the higher ground. Any step outside cover will lead to a face full of bullets.</p>

        <div class="flex mt-8">
            <div class="w-2/3 pr-4">
                <p>The gas cloud that stink bombs create can offer a bit of respite from the eyes of the enemy. Each bomb emits a small cloud of green gas that can be used to make maneuvers between different types of cover. A combination of three bombs, the amount each pickup comes with, can allow you to easy move out of you opponent's line of site and help you flank them.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Use the smell to clear out chokepoints</h2>

        <p class="mt-4">Building is key in Fortnite. One dominant strategy for gunfights is to build higher than your opponent, and sometimes that mentality comes before the fight even starts, with people building towers inside the circle and waiting.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Stink bombs are a great counter to this strategy. Their gas permeates through the structure. It can either be thrown through one empty part of the structure, force them to abandon their home, or hit them directly and cause a good bit of damage. This strategy also works well in areas of the map that have built in chokepoints like Dusty Depot. Stink bombs can be perfect for scenarios when you catch other players hiding in the back of trucks, in storage units, or in any long hallway.</p>
