            <p class="mt-6 text-lg">It's that time of year when college students are thinking about or getting ready for their first year of college life. Living on campus or off campus and staying within your budget can be challenging. I was lucky and live only a few miles from the university. I was able to furnish their apartments, small flats, or dorms. Being a college student, I had to pay cool resources to show them some of the large and thrift stores around the area that could help them save money to pay. This made for happy, and it allowed for other activities such as fun road trips.</p>

            <p class="mt-4 text-lg">No matter how big or small your budget maybe in college, every student can benefit from thrift stores. Here is my list of 7 Things College Students Should Buy at Thrift Stores that will help you save some cash.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-8 text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">1. T-Shirts</h2>

            <p class="mt-6 text-lg">I cannot stress this one enough. Buy your t-shirts at thrift stores. I cannot stress this one enough. Buy your t-shirts at thrift stores.

            </div>

            <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Shirts at thrift stores tend to be very cheap allowing money to be spent on additional items.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-8 text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">2. Pants and Jeans</h2>

            <p class="mt-6 text-lg">What was said above about t-shirts also applies to pants and jeans. That chemistry lab class, while almost always safe, does have the potential to stain or trash your clothes. Keep those thrift store clothes cheap $5-$9 or grab that nice pair of Levi jeans to wear for when you go out on the town and wear those dress pants to class.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Pants & Jeans can be purchased at thrift stores for a small fraction of retail costs.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-8 text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">3. Accessories</h2>

            <p class="mt-6 text-lg">Since you are buying t-shirts and pants at the thrift store you should swing over to the accessories section and do a little shopping. Belts, ties, scarves, bags, purses, and vintage jewelry are always in stock and often overlooked. I have found more high dollar accessories at thrift stores for a fraction of what one would pay in retail stores. For men, a mid range class leather belt can easily run $50. At a thrift store that belt might be only $5 and in near new condition.</p>
