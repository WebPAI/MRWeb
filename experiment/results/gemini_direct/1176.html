            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mb-4">I'm wearing my headphones so I don't have to talk to you...</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-500 mb-4"><a href="https://shindotv.wordpress.com/2008/09/25/donttalktome/" class="hover:text-gray-700">SEPTEMBER 25, 2008</a> - <a href="https://shindotv.wordpress.com/author/shindoverse/" class="hover:text-gray-700">SHINICHI</a></p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Yesterday, I was at <a href="http://www.twiggs.org/simpo/custom/twiggs_org/content/home/index.aspx" class="text-teal-700 hover:underline">Twiggs</a> in <a href="http://gothere.com/UniversityHeights/" class="text-teal-700 hover:underline">University Heights</a> to unwind after a day of teaching, around 6'ish pm, when I saw some people with clipboards hanging around outside by the entrance. I didn't know what they were up, nor did I find ever find out. I just didn't care to find out. They may have even been working for some cause I'm for, but the strategic ambush posture didn't go very well with me.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">As I did my Internetting and sipped my coffee, I thought of my exit strategy. I imagined being rude, I contemplated simply running past them, and I thought of running towards the street corner and crossing the street. I just did not want to engage in conversation with them at all, as they would have kept talking so I would buy whatever they wanted to sell, whether it was making a contribution to their cause or consider their product. It reminded me of when I was recently in Washington DC walking around in Chinatown, only to be accosted by someone from <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/" class="text-teal-700 hover:underline">Greenpeace</a>. I didn't mind the initial conversation, but I did not want to get roped into making a donation right there on the spot. I simply made an excuse that I had to meet some friends to get away from her, but the woman wasn't too happy that I got out of her grip.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">I settled on wearing my headphones and listening to my <a href="http://www.ipod.com/" class="text-teal-700 hover:underline">iPod</a>. However, they weren't deterred as two of them tried to rush me when I was a few feet out the door. I then put my hand up in the classic "talk to the hand" gesture and moved on. I called Twiggs afterwards to voice a complaint about the clipboard people.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">A part of me felt rude for quickly dismissing them like that. However, I resent that they placed themselves in a position where they had a captive audience.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The outdoor solicitor problem got so bad at the <a href="http://traderjoes.com/" class="text-teal-700 hover:underline">Trader Joe's</a> in <a href="http://gothere.com/Hillcrest/index.htm" class="text-teal-700 hover:underline">Hillcrest/Uptown</a> area that they put up a sign telling customers that they were not obligated to talk to these street hawkers. It's pretty bad when we need institutional blessings to say "No."</p>
