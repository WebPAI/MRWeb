            <p class="mb-4">1. ÜBER ALONSO</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The Fernando Alonso that fell foul of tyre degradation and Webber's end of race pace in Silverstone prevailed here in Germany. The strategy worked for him in qualifying superbly and here it preserved and protected his race win, giving the Spaniard a comfortable lead over his closest competitors of the Red Bull Racing duo. Alonso controlled the race with ease, and it was only in the latter stages of the race that he had any company in the form of a resurgent Jenson Button and then a suddenly interested Sebastian Vettel. But unlike Silverstone he had enough left in reserve to manage Button, who had chipped the gap down to under a second in places.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">2. #100LEWIS</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                It would have been a sweet result if Lewis Hamilton could have emulated his team mate's result on his 200th race, however it wasn't meant to be. A right rear puncture scuppered his race completely, and his subsequent calls to be retired must have raised some eyebrows in his garage as he was then encouraged to continue.
