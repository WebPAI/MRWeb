            One of the advantages of being a perpetual student in spring break. At my new school of Art, we had two spring breaks: one because the school at the school of Art and Design is building increasing enrollment and there are no more spring break excursions outside of France. Two years ago, in southeast France, when I took my car down to Nice, I have this sentiment though. I look forward to the point in time this trend turns around. I can always remember. <br>

            Toulouse historically was a very important municipality in the only French province governed by the Counts. Toulouse was considered by the Visigoths to be the capital of the Visigoths. The political influence of the Counts of Toulouse extended throughout southern France, and long am I to say that Toulouse was independent. So it was in the south of France, during the Council of Toulouse in the year 1229, the Cathars, who were persecuted by the Church in this campaign against heresy, with the Cathars and sympathizers, made a bloody war. The 1229 Council of Paris established in Toulouse the first French (and possibly the first institution of higher learning in France) university, which was founded by the Spanish monarchy during the Inquisition wars, which had been founded in Toulouse during the Albigensian Crusade. Having lost the battle during the Treaty of Meaux in the year 1229, as can be seen in the gallery below. They actually took up residence in the breathtaking location. Toulouse celebrates its rich traditions. (You can see several photos from Les Jacobins in the gallery below).
