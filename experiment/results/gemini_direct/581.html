                        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Should Kids Lift Weights? By Brett Klika C.S.C.S.</h1>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">April 30, 2013</p>
                        <img src="http://www.healthyourwayonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/HYWO.Baseball-150x150.jpg" alt="" class="float-left mr-4 mb-4">
                        <p>“How old should my child be to lift weights?” This is one of the more common questions I get from parents of active youth.  Ungodly amounts of ads for stunted growth, fractured growth plates, and prematurely imitated physiques have made parents, and society for that matter, reticent to involve youth in weight training.</p>
                        <p>The fact is, there is no scientific evidence to suggest a perfect chronological age to start weight training. Research has not demonstrated any negative health consequences for weight training in youth, assuming proper movement is introduced concurrently with appropriate progressive increases in training load.</p>
                        <p>Despite what infomercials have created around improper weight introduction in fitness, injuries are primarily due to equipment accidents (weight falling on them in the gym), or overzealous coaching rendering the subject, the current program and the movement pattern itself unsafe.</p>
                        <p>They have demonstrated they do not need any additional load to make it effective.  The critical questions in regards to youth and weight training become:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Is the proper execution of task?</li>
                            <li>Are they able to execute and repeat enough to respond with proper movement and not just momentum?</li>
                            <li>Are they mature and coordinated enough to respond to coaching cues?</li>
                            <li>Are they interested in weight training?</li>
                            <li>Is the person in charge of their program experienced and knowledgeable about progression?</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>If the answer to any of the above is “no”, it doesn’t matter the age of the child, they are not ready for weight training.  In this case, I would focus on merely learning movement through a variety of movement patterns without additional challenge or weight.</p>
                        <p>When a child is able to focus on an organized challenge in which they execute and repeat to the best answer to “When should my child begin lifting weights” is “When they are ready.”</p>

                        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Exercise Tips for New Moms by Tatum Rebelle</h1>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">April 24, 2013</p>
                        <img src="http://www.healthyourwayonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/HYWO.Baby_-150x150.jpg" alt="" class="float-left mr-4 mb-4">
                        <p>Get back to the basics:</p>
                        <p>Before resuming your exercise program post-delivery, always get medical clearance from your doctor first. Do not fall for the promising quick and easy results like they were before pregnancy. Your body has gone through a new fitness trend or marketing gimmicks.</p>
                        <p>Stick to the fundamentals that have been proven to work. You will burn more calories doing intervals a great way to add intensity for even faster results. You can do this on the treadmill, elliptical, bike, swimming and by exercising larger muscle groups.</p>
                        <p>For example, by exercising larger muscle groups you will burn more calories. Doing both is a great way to add intensity for even faster results. Workouts are great for both the mind and body.</p>
                        <p>Work smarter not harder:</p>
                        <p>Finding time to exercise as a new mom can be tough! You’r daily workouts can be activities that you’re already doing by learning exercises that include your baby in the workout.</p>
                        <p>Squats are tough on your thighs, and soothing for your baby. They can be done against your chest and benefit you both. Exercises like pushups, plank, cat-cow can be performed with your baby is lying underneath while giving them kisses and smiling at them. It’s a fun way to enjoy time together while also doing something good for you.</p>
                        <p>Invest in inexpensive equipment for your home like a stability ball and resistance band. That way there is no excuse not workout when you can’t get to the gym.</p>
                        <p>Walk before you run:</p>
                        <p>Build slowly back to your pre-pregnancy fitness routine. Do not simply jump right back in to what you were doing before.</p>
                        <p>It is necessary to repair the deeper ab muscles that have been stretched. First, do not start with crunches. You can begin to rehab your abs with deep breathing exercises, plank, bridge, and pelvic tilt. If you were a runner then start with walking and jogging before returning to running. If you lifted heavy weights, start lighter and do high repetitions.</p>
                        <p>Simply going back to your old routine will do your body a disservice if you end up injured and can’t do anything at all.</p>
                        <p>Don’t compare:</p>
                        <p>Be patient and nice to yourself. Don’t compare your body or weight loss to celebrities. It is not fair to measure yourself next to someone who probably has a full-time trainer and chef, whose profession possibly requires them to be a size 2.</p>
                        <p>Remember that it took 9 months to put the weight on, and to drop it overnight is not healthy or realistic. Steady, consistent exercise and weight loss is the best way to decrease fat and keep it off permanently.</p>
                        <p>Kegels:</p>
                        <p>Do them! I can’t stress this enough. Keeping your pelvic muscles strong is often overlooked, but so important.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">March 18, 2013</p>
                        <img src="http://www.healthyourwayonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/HYWO.Study_-150x150.jpg" alt="" class="float-left mr-4 mb-4">
                        <p>Can you believe it’s nearly spring? Before we know it the school summer term will be here and children throughout the northern hemisphere will be studying for exams.</p>
                        <p>Whilst study and revision time is important for securing good grades many experts now agree that what we eat and how much we move also play an important role.</p>
                        <p>Here are the top three areas of brain super foods:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Healthy oils – foods such as oily fish, avocado, hemp, flax and fish oil capsules contain the omega 3 fatty acids EPA and DHA which have proven very beneficial to the workings of the brain. Unfortunately the western diet tends to be very rich in omega 6 fatty acids which the brain makes from omega 3. It tends to be a bit like a diesel car trying to run on unleaded petrol. Omega 3 needs to be topping up. We must keep them properly hydrated by drinking plenty of water.</li>
                            <li>Water – our brains are 75% water. We must keep them properly hydrated by drinking plenty of water.</li>
                            <li>Blueberries – these little berries are little power houses of brain goodness. They are full of healthy antioxidants and packed with vitamin C. They have been proven to help with memory and cognitive function.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Here’s a Brain Super Food recipe to get you started:</p>
                        <p>Banana and Peanut Butter Flapjack</p>
                        <p>Makes about 12</p>
                        <p>3.5oz/100g butter</p>
                        <p>1.75oz/50g soft brown sugar</p>
                        <p>1.75oz/50g honey</p>
                        <p>1 banana – mashed</p>
                        <p>1.75oz/50g no added sugar crunchy peanut butter</p>
                        <p>8oz/225g porridge oats</p>
                        <p>Preheat the oven to 320F/160C.</p>
                        <p>Melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the sugar, honey and peanut butter and cook until softened.</p>
                        <p>Remove from the heat and stir in the banana and porridge oats.</p>
                        <p>Turn into a greased and lined cake tin. Push into corners with a spoon. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes until golden brown.</p>
                        <p>Mark into rectangles and leave to cool before lifting out.</p>

                        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">What NOT to say to your Teen! By Maggie Ayre</h1>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">January 28, 2013</p>

                        <p>5 Things Never to Say to Your Teenager During their Sporting Event</p>
                        <p>Maggie is the UK leading Fitness Coach for Teens. As a teenager she was a member of the British Sailing Team. She is no stranger to competitive sport for teens and knows just how important parental support is.</p>
                        <p>However, sometimes parents get it wrong and say the wrong thing at the wrong time. Here Maggie shares her top 5 things never to say to your teenager during their sporting event.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Don’t Mention What Happened ‘Last Time’<br>
                            So your teen’s been here before she’s in pole position going into the final event, sits her bench and the team lead in the last. Last time it all went wrong in the closing stages. Whatever you do – don’t mention last time. Your teen doesn’t need reminding. Instead stick to positive comments only no negative comments allowed.</li>
                            <li>Don’t Change the Plan<br>
                            If your teen never eats during a cycle race now is not the time to suggest a snack. Changes to routine should always be introduced during training.</li>
                            <li>Don’t Criticize the Competition<br>
                            The most successful sports men and women tend to be friends with everyone in their chosen sport. This season’s main competition may be next seasons training partner. Avoid making personal comments.</li>
                            <li>Let Them Focus<br>
                            Now is not the time to mention the maths homework that needs to be done by tomorrow morning.</li>
                            <li>Stay in the Moment<br>
                            There’s time for celebration after the event is finished and a podium position or personal best secured. Now is not the time to be talking about the future. Don’t ask ‘what will you do if you’re when you’ve won’ or ‘what’s the next step now if it didn’t go so well’ until another day.</li>
                        </ol>
