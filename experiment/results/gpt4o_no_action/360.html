            <p>The German Grand Prix started off by degradation and Webber’s end of race pass to Alonso was penalized here in Germany. It was a race that was equally notable for what didn’t happen and what almost happened. While the podium was made up of the usual suspects, the race itself was not particularly exciting. It was a race of attrition, with the top three drivers all having to nurse their cars home. But it was also a race that was decided on the final lap, as unexpected drama struck and a couple of drivers were left to rue their luck. Alonso’s win has been long in coming, but Ferrari’s return to form has been a long time coming. It was a race that had it all, but ultimately it was a race of attrition.</p>

            <p>Yet there were flashes, but they didn’t come at the right times. Rain almost turned his fortunes around, but he was only 30 seconds from a downpour that never came. McLaren were saved from any real trouble, Button and Hamilton’s early pitstops ultimately meant nothing, and Red Bull’s qualifying pace was just a yard too far for degradation. However Schumacher made many appearances and Hulkenberg featured where he should be.</p>
