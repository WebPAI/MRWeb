        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center">Tunnocks Supporting a new St Abbs Lifeboat</h1>
        <p class="text-center text-gray-600">24 November 2015</p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-800">
            St Abbs Lifeboat is delighted to announce that an approach has been received from leading Scottish Company Thomas Tunnock & Sons Ltd. "Tunnocks" involving a new Lifeboat at St Abbs Berwickshire.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-800">
            It is expected that this will lead to the completion of Stage 1 of the Appeal launched in early Autumn 2015 and enable the resumption of Lifeboat operations at St Abbs in 2016.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-800">
            The public appeal for a new Lifeboat at St Abbs has already got off to a flying start and the campaign will remain in full swing with a Stage 2 objective of raising a further Â£250k to provide long term financial support for the St Abbs Lifeboat Station.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-800">
            In announcing the approach from Tunnocks Alistair Crowe the Lifeboat Appeal Chairman said:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="mt-4 text-gray-800 italic">
            "This is a highly significant development and the emergence of Tunnocks as a major donor has unanimous support from the Community of St Abbs. On behalf of the St Abbs Community I would like to express my sincere gratitude not only to Tunnocks, but also to all our other donations big and small."
        </blockquote>
        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-800">
            We look forward to becoming an operational Lifeboat Station at St Abbs again as soon as arrangements can be put in place, which will include a new purpose built boat. There are details still to be agreed with Tunnocks, which will include the name of the new Lifeboat, and a further announcement will be made in due course."
